==Story==

===Setting and characters===
{{incomplete|section|date=July 2013}}
Set in the fictional town of Edgewater, the ''Jisei'' series follows the [[protagonist]]: an unidentified American teenager who later takes the codename &quot;Kangai&quot;. Kangai has a strange psychic ability: he can relive the dying moments of any dead body he touches, as well as sense when someone nearby has died. Shortly after he returns to his homeown in Edgewater, Kangai meets three other people who are part of a government agency: Aki Mizutani, the group's brash and impulsive leader; Naoki Mizutani, Aki's younger twin brother and the group's voice of reason; and Li Mei, a quiet girl with an unsettling aura around her. Kangai learns that all four have similar psychic abilities, called ''kansei''—Aki can speak directly into anyone's mind, using it to either talk to another ''kansei'' without speaking or persuading &quot;normal&quot; people subconsciously; Naoki can [[eidetic memory|remember anything he has experienced]], making him useful for undercover work; and Li Mei can sense the emotions of those around her, so much that she has to sort out which emotions are hers and which aren't. They are part of a government agency under supervision of Mikolaj Gurski, a police detective.&lt;ref name=jisei_about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sakevisual.com/jisei/about.html |title=About &amp;#124; Jisei - A supernatural murder mystery game by sakevisual |publisher=sakevisual.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jisei_characters&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sakevisual.com/jisei/characters.html |title=Characters &amp;#124; Jisei - A supernatural murder mystery game by sakevisual |publisher=sakevisual.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kansei_about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sakevisual.com/kansei/ |title=About &amp;#124; Kansei - A supernatural murder mystery game by sakevisual |publisher=sakevisual.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kansei_characters&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sakevisual.com/kansei/characters.html |title=Characters &amp;#124; Kansei - A supernatural murder mystery game by sakevisual |publisher=sakevisual.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''Jisei'' begins, the protagonist wakes from a nap inside the café, and suddenly feels ill. Heading to the restroom, he discovers a dead woman on the floor, with a knife in her chest. He touches the woman to experience her final moments; he finds out that someone had [[suffocated]] the woman. When the protagonist comes to, he finds Jennifer Bergstrom watching him, claiming him as the murderer. Detective Gurski, who happened to be at the café coincidentally, decides to question everyone present—Chance Jackson, Jennifer Bergstrom, Kizaki Suitani and the protagonist.

Determined to prove his innocence, the protagonist questions the suspects present and examines the café. He discovers used [[duct tape]] in the trash in the men's restroom. After collecting all clues, the protagonist converses with Gurski about it and identifies the culprit. It turns out that the culprit is Jennifer Bergstrom, and that the victim is Sara Blackmoore. Both women were employees for Biodev Imaging, and Sara had stolen research from Auten Engineering, Biodev's competitors, for Bergstrom. However, Sara decided to double cross her employer in favor of a third party that offered her more money. When the protagonist, Gurski, and Kizaki confront Bergstrom, she tries to run; the others manage to trap her, however, and she confesses. Detective Gurski snaps a pair of handcuffs on her wrists and leads her outside. Kizaki, who says his real name is Naoki, wants the protagonist to help him finding out who the third party Sara mentioned is. Later, Naoki's twin sister, Aki, shows up personally and offers the protagonist to work with them. However, she makes clear that he needs their help more than they need his.

In the epilogue, it is revealed that Chance played a double role as well. She calls someone, telling them that she could not get the USB drive they wanted. Then she claims that she found someone the person has been looking for—the main protagonist.

After the events of ''Jisei'', the protagonist finds himself tangled in another murder case when the owner of a high-profile corporation dies under mysterious circumstances. This time, however, he's forced to team up with a group of kids with abilities as strange as his own. Early in the game, Aki gives the protagonist a nickname, &quot;Kangai&quot;, as he wants to keep his true name hidden.

Aki drives Kangai, Naoki, and Li Mei to the house of William Auten, the chairperson of Auten Engineering. There, they met Mr. Auten's assistant Sophia Millerson, as well as Detective Mikolaj Gurski, who was invited because he solved the murder case the day before. Furthermore, Kangai meets the reporter Marissa Klein, Mr. Auten's nephew Liam, and the IT guy Kevin Nealy. When Kangai and the others are asked to go into William Auten's office and Mr. Auten sees Kangai through a camera, he seems to recognize him and wants to throw him out of the house. He is frightened of him and he does not want to meet him any more. When suddenly William Auten is found dead in his office, Kangai has to solve the case. While he is looking for clues, he learns from Li Mei, that she, Aki, and Naoki work for the government, that they are on probation for past crimes, and that Detective Gurski is their probation officer.

Kangai finds an SD card in a box in Mr. Auten's museum. Shortly after, it turns out that Kevin has poisoned Mr. Auten. Kevin takes Li Mei hostage and threatens her with a knife. Suddenly Detective Gurski comes into the room, he calls Kangai Alex. Together they are able to catch Kevin and to arrest him. The next day Detective Gurski comes over to tell Alex and the others that Kevin has confessed and that Liam has disappeared.

In the epilogue is Liam, who has obtained some things for Chance. Judging from their conversation it could be that Liam and Chance are siblings or half-siblings. After Liam has given her the things which she wanted to have for years, she lets him leave. She tells him that he should enjoy the rest of his pitiful life. According to her, there is not much left of it after all.

==Reception==
''Jisei'' received moderate to positive reception. It received a score of 90/100 on Gamertell, with reviewer Jenni Lada writing &quot;Jisei goes above and beyond. It feels incredibly professional, and more like a major developer's accomplishment than that of a fairly new independent developer. The character art is wonderful, the voice acting appropriate, the story interesting and the general gameplay mechanics well executed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamertell.com/technologytell/article/gamertell-review-jisei-for-pc-mac-and-linux/|title=Jisei Visual Novel Game Review (Gamertell)|year=2011|accessdate=2011-08-28|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mania.com gave the game similar praise, calling it &quot;An engaging visual novel from a promising new group.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/jisei-visual-novel-game-review_article_123122.html|title=Jisei Visual Novel Game Review (Mania)|year=2011|accessdate=2011-08-28|work=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928093802/http://www.mania.com/jisei-visual-novel-game-review_article_123122.html|archivedate=2011-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gamezebo criticized its short gameplay length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezebo.com/games/jisei/review|title=Jisei Review (Gamezebo)|year=2011|accessdate=2011-08-28|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kansei'' received mostly positive reception. It received a score of 93/100 on Gamertell, with reviewer Jenni Lada writing &quot;Length aside, Kansei is a really beautiful game. It is a much improvement over Jisei in terms of interactivity and plot, with a story that is more intriguing and has additional twists to discover. Not only that, but it looks and sounds beautiful. It’s a wonderful visual novel and quite involving.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Jenni Lada |date=July 20, 2011 | title=Review: Kansei for Windows, Mac, Linux | url=http://www.gamertell.com/technologytell/article/kansei-for-windows-mac-linux-review-sakevisual/ | accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kansei'' was chosen to be the English Visual Novel of the Year in 2011 by ''VNs Now!''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |year=2012 |title=Visual Novel of the Year |url=http://www.vnsnow.com/best-ofs.html |work= |accessdate=January 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411120648/http://www.vnsnow.com/best-ofs.html |archivedate=April 11, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have criticized the game's mystery elements. Visual novel reviewer anonl called it &quot;a clear step up from Jisei, but the murder mystery is still lackluster.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=anonl | year=2013 | title=[review] Kansei | url=http://www.weeaboo.nl/2013/06/review-kansei/ | work= | accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Yousei'' received mostly positive reception. ''Yousei'' was given 8/10 points by ''VNs Now!'', saying &quot;Yousei is still one of the strongest EVN you’re going to play this year and more than worth the asking price&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |year=2013 |title=Yousei: The Third Investigation Review |url=http://www.vnsnow.com/yousei.html |work= |accessdate=January 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412061408/http://www.vnsnow.com/yousei.html |archivedate=April 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; GamerTell gave a rating of B to ''Yousei'', saying &quot;What made Yousei so fun and enjoyable was it’s cool voice acting, realistic characters, great story, multiple endings, and replay-ability.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Moen, Jessica|title=Review: Yousei for the PC|date=24 February 2013|url=http://www.technologytell.com/gaming/108452/review-yousei-for-the-pc/|work=GamerTell|accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Siren''===
{{Main|Siren (video game)}}
''Siren'' is the first installment in the series and was released in November 2003 for the [[PlayStation 2]].

The game is set in a remote Japanese mountain village named {{nihongo|Hanuda|羽生蛇村|Hanyūda Mura}}, which is described as being very traditional and particularly exclusive society. Following the interruption of a ritual in the forest near midnight and a subsequent earthquake, the village teeters between time and space, with an infinite sea of red water in place of the usual surrounding mountains. The crux of the story focuses on the efforts of Hisako Yao, the leader of a local religion, to resurrect or re-awaken a being known as Datatsushi through an occult ceremony. The siren of the title is the call of Datatsushi, summoning the residents of Hanuda to immerse themselves in the red water, thus creating an army of subordinates called {{nihongo|shibito|屍人||lit. &quot;corpse people&quot;}}. The shibito then go about building a nest to house the corporeal form of Datatsushi once it is summoned, as well as killing and converting any living humans left in Hanuda. The story is told through the perspectives of ten survivors, some of whom are natives of Hanuda, and is presented out of chronological order over the three days in which the mystery takes place.

===''Forbidden Siren 2''===
{{Main|Forbidden Siren 2}}
''Forbidden Siren 2'' is the second installment in the series and was released in February 2006. The game tells the story of several characters who become trapped on Yamijima, an island off the coast of mainland Japan. On August 3, 1976, an underwater cable was cut, and all power to the island was lost. During the subsequent blackout, all of the islanders disappeared and the island became deserted. Twenty-nine years later, in 2005, a magazine editor called Mamoru Itsuki is visiting the island to conduct research for an article when the ferry he and a small group of other passengers are on capsizes, after it is hit by a red tidal wave. Shortly after his arrival, a group of soldiers crash land on the island after their helicopter has engine troubles. They must all find ways to survive the island's &quot;monsters&quot;, the shibito.

The game is played through several character perspectives, each with his or her own strengths and weaknesses, through an overlapping timeline of the fateful night that alternates between the present and the past. The story can unfold in different ways with, in many cases, two or more different versions of a level, which will have slightly different objectives than the original. If the player is thorough and plays through these optional versions, the story and characters may develop even further than before.

===''Siren: Blood Curse''===

{{Main|Siren: Blood Curse}}
''Siren: Blood Curse'' is the third installment in the series and was released in July 2008. The game is a [[video game remake|&quot;reimagining&quot;]] of the first game and it tells the story of an American camera crew's disappearance in a mountainous region in Japan.  On August 3, 2007, an American TV crew visits the area of Hanuda Village, Japan, a mountain village that vanished completely in 1976.  At the same time, an American high school student has also traveled to Hanuda due to a mysterious e-mail message that he had received.  At nighttime, the crew stumble upon a ritual (called a Mana ritual) being performed where they watch local murdered as part of the ritual.  As another local was about to be sacrificed, the American student intervenes and saves the local, then goes out to find help.  In the process of getting help, he encounters a policeman that tries to kill him.  Meanwhile, the sacrificed local revives as a Shibito, a &quot;monster&quot; of Hanuda, and attacks the camera crew.

{{Nihongo|'''''The Last Story'''''|ラストストーリー|Rasuto Sutōrī|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[action role-playing game]], developed by [[Mistwalker]] and [[AQ Interactive]] for the [[Wii]] video game console. [[Nintendo]] published the title in all regions except for North America, where it was published by [[Xseed Games]]. Initially released in Japan in 2011, the game was released in western territories through 2012. ''The Last Story'' takes place upon the island fortress of Lazulis, in a world that is slowly being drained of life by an unknown force. The story focuses on a group of mercenaries looking for work on Lazulis; one of their number, Zael, dreams of becoming a knight. After receiving the mystical &quot;Mark of the Outsider&quot;, Zael becomes involved with a noblewoman named Calista in an ongoing war between humans and the beast-like Gorak. During gameplay, the player controls Zael as he and the mercenary group to which he belongs undertake missions on Lazulis. Zael can command the rest of the mercenary squad during missions, and fights in battles that involve action, tactical and stealth elements. Multiple online multiplayer modes are also present.

The game was directed and co-written by [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], the original creator of ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', who had the initial idea for the title after seeing the mixed responses to ''[[Blue Dragon (video game)|Blue Dragon]]'' and ''[[Lost Odyssey]]''. Together with designer Takuya Matsumoto, Sakaguchi decided to make a game that would be different from his previous work and most other role-playing games. Development took between three and four years according to different sources. Its story was originally based in science fiction, but at Nintendo's insistence it was changed to be primarily based around fantasy. Among the staff were regular ''Final Fantasy'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], and illustrator Kimihiko Fujisaka. It was originally going to be exclusive to Japan, and later its North American release was in doubt after being announced for release in Europe and Australia. During this time, a fan campaign called [[Operation Rainfall]] drew considerable attention to the title. The title was a commercial success, and received generally positive reviews worldwide: while the gameplay generally met with praise, opinions varied on the story and graphics.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:The Last Story gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|Player character Zael and his party facing one of the game's bosses.]]
''The Last Story'' is an [[action role-playing game]] (ARPG) incorporating elements of [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical]] and [[Stealth game|stealth]] gameplay. The player controls main protagonist Zael for the majority of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;NWRpreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGreview&quot;/&gt; Zael is primarily controlled using the [[Wii Remote]] from a fixed third-person view. The game can be controlled using the [[Wii Remote]] and [[Wii Nunchuk|Nunchuk]], or the [[Classic Controller]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NWRpreview&quot;/&gt; The game's main hub is a public house on Lazulis Island, which also houses a save point for players. Lazulis City is the main setting for most of the game, which provides the player with access to side quests, shops, and areas to collect items when not engaged in the main story. In addition to environments within missions such as ruins and forests where enemies are encountered and fought, there is an arena where the player can improve the party and their combat abilities. If the party is victorious, the party can pick up money and items from [[non-playable character]]s betting on the fight.&lt;ref name=&quot;NWRpreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GSreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LastTension&quot;/&gt;

In battle, the player controls Zael alone, with the rest of the party being controlled by the game's [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] (AI) and directed by player commands.&lt;ref name=&quot;NWRpreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GSreview&quot;/&gt; Parties are composed of up to six characters, each with five &quot;lives&quot;, with them automatically reviving after a certain time if Zael cannot revive them manually.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGreview&quot;/&gt; The attack directions of both party characters and enemies are represented by lines connecting the different characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;AndriaTwitter&quot;/&gt; Combat plays out in real-time, with attacks either happening automatically when a character is within range or manually. Actions such as dodging and movement are done manually. Blocking and actions such as vaulting over low obstacles are performed by holding the B button. Zael can also move to take cover behind objects, which allows them to break an enemy's line of sight on them or creep along walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;NWRpreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GSreview&quot;/&gt; During combat, a character's Tension gauge will fill, enabling the performance of special moves: these can vary from dealing damage to enemies across a wide area to reviving unconscious allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastTension&quot;/&gt;

A skill unique to Zael is Gathering: when activated, all enemies within an area will focus their attention on him, allowing other team members to act without interruption. As the game progresses, Zael can issue commands to the other team members, with the perspective switching to a top-down view for this action.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNreview&quot;/&gt; In addition to standard combat, players can switch to a behind-the-shoulder perspective for manually firing Zael's crossbow, which can launch a variety of ammunition at enemies and objects. Enemies in Zael's sights will have their weaknesses and abilities revealed.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LastFocus&quot;/&gt; In battle, destructible objects in the environment can be used by the party to defeat enemies; these objects regenerate after a time rather than remaining destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;AndriaTwitter&quot;/&gt; Magic cast by certain characters with that ability leave the casting area temporarily imbued with a spell's elemental properties creating a magic circle. These circles can cause elemental damage or effects to enemies within the area, or they can imbue the weapons of characters who walk into the circle with said element. Eventually, Zael will learn the ability to &quot;diffuse&quot; magic circles which will spread the spell's effect which varies depending on the element. .&lt;ref name=&quot;AndriaTwitter&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LastMagic&quot;/&gt;

In addition to the single-player campaign, players have access to online multiplayer through the game's main menu. The multiplayer features two modes: a competitive mode where players face each other in various stages, and a co-op mode where a team of players face bosses from the single-player campaign. For the competitive match, the player can choose from multiple allied and enemy characters, and all boons granted by equipment or experience levels are removed to level the playing field. Teams of up to six players can be formed for team matches. Players gain or lose points when they defeat or are defeated by an opponent, and defeated enemies respawn in the battlefield. When all opponents have been defeated, all players are awarded with items and equipment that can carry over into the single-player campaign: those who performed the best receive higher-quality equipment and &quot;titles&quot; ti distinguish them from other players. The co-op battles allow players to carry over their equipment and character levels from single-player, with the available characters being restricted to Zael's mercenary group. Defeating a boss earns players items themed around it. In both modes, players communicate using a stock of scripted responses both taken from the single-player campaign and specially created for multiplayer.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastMultiplayer&quot;/&gt;

== Synopsis ==
''The Last Story'' is set on Lazulis Island, a vast seaborne fortress ruled by Count Arganan and allied to an unnamed human empire in the midst of crisis as the land decays and dies. Dagran, a mercenary, travels to Lazulis in search of employment with the mercenary band he leads: Zael, Syrenne, Yurick, Lowell and Mirania. During the journey, Zael, who dreams of becoming a knight, encounters a mysterious force and is branded on the hand, granting him magical power. While on an errand in town, Zael runs into a woman named Lisa and helps her escape from city guards. Employed as guards to Count Arganan for the wedding of his niece, Lady Calista, to Lord Jirall, Zael encounters Calista and recognizes her as &quot;Lisa&quot;. The group also meet General Asthar and his protegee Therius when Syrenne picks a fight with Therius. After Calista explains to Zael in private that hers is an arranged marriage, Lazulis is attacked by the Gurak, a race once banished from Lazulis by humans and now united under their ruler Zangurak. To avoid being killed by the ensuing cannon fire, Zael, Dagran, and Calista stow away on a Gurak ship and eventually take it over. The group are returned to Lazulis by the island's knights. On Lazulis, the mercenaries are accused of aiding the Gurak by Jirall, who is trying to cover up his cowardly behavior during the Gurak attack by having anyone who witnessed it imprisoned. Dagran persuades Arganan to release them after showing him Zael's mark, which is revealed to be a mystical &quot;Mark of the Outsider&quot; destined to save Lazulis from disaster.

Arganan attempts to get Zael onto his side, offering him knighthood and Calista's hand in marriage. Zael swears allegiance to Arganan, who orders Zael to direct Lazulis towards the Gurak lands. During this time, Asthar accepts Zael as a new pupil and gives him a medal following a successful sparring. Shortly after this, Gurak assassins attack. Asthar is killed, telling Zael the medal is a key before dying. Zael is accused of Asthar's murder by Jirall and imprisoned. Calista frees him. Dagran suggests Jirall is likely the real killer, and prompts Zael to search Jirall's room, where he finds the murder weapon and a letter revealing dealings with the Gurak. Jirall is imprisoned, freeing Calista to be betrothed to Zael. When Zael's suspicions are later aroused, Dagran admits to him that he framed Jirall in order to ensure Zael's liberty. Lazulis arrives in Gurak lands and takes their keep with minimal resistance. Zael learns there that the Gurak are suffering the same degradation of the land as humans are, which motivated their invasion. Zael's brand reacts with Calista's blood and Asthar's medal to reveal a secret location on Lazulis. Joined by Therius, they enter and meet a Sorceress, who reveals that the &quot;Outsider&quot; is an extraterrestrial being that absorbs energy. At the bidding of her lover, Arganan's ancestor, she summoned the Outsider to the planet in an attempt to end conflict. After realizing that it was destroying the land in order to collect its energy, they split it into two halves in order to slow the land's death. If the two halves, now respectively controlled by humans and the Gurak, are reunited and released, the land's decay will halt and the motive for the war will no longer exist.

Realizing Arganan must have known of this, Zael refuses his knighthood and sets out with Calista to destroy Lazulis' cannon, which is powered by Lazulis' half of the Outsider. However, when the Gurak attack Lazulis they decide to instead help Arganan use the cannon to drive off the attack. The cannon's fire proves insufficient, and Arganan is mysteriously killed by its power. The Gurak overrun Lazulis. Calista and the mercenaries head out to retrieve Zangurak's half of the Outsider, only to find its power has already been taken. Once they remove it, the Gurak fortress starts to crumble, knocking Zael and Calista into the ocean. They are rescued by Gurak ships. On board is Jirall, who has been given a cursed sword by Zangurak for him to kill Zael. Realizing the sword is affecting Jirall's mind, Zael tries to save Jirall by disarming him, but the cursed sword moves unaided and kills Jirall. Meanwhile, the Gurak take Calista to Zangurak.

The mercenaries pursue Zangurak to Lazulis Island. Lowell is fatally injured by a Gurak warrior. Zael finds Calista with Zangurak, who has used her Arganan blood and the Gurak half of the Outsider to anoint his right arm. After the group defeats Zangurak, he rips off his right arm and sends it to use the full power of the Outsider to revive him. However, Dagran kills Zangurak's arm so he can use the Arganan blood and Outsider half on it for himself. He reveals that he murdered Asthar because he learned that Asthar had commanded the Lazulis knights who killed his family. He has been collaborating with Zangurak with the ultimate goal of using the Outsider to remake the world so the mercenaries have a better life. Finding he is still not powerful enough to defeat the group, Dagran tries to absorb the Lazulis half of the Outsider into the center of his body, giving Zael an opening to kill him. Dagran reconciles with the group before dying, then his spirit uses the Outsider's energy to resurrect Lowell. Zael and Calista reunite the two halves of the Outsider, which leaves the planet after explaining that its true purpose is to collect scattered energy in outer space and use it to create life on new worlds. Humans and Gurak begin coexisting, sharing their technology and using Lazulis as a neutral land where the two races freely interact. Therius decides to train new knights in the empire while leaving Lazulis in Zael's care, Zael and Calista are married in her ancient family home, the mercenaries hold a funeral for Dagran, and Zael is finally made a knight by Calista.

==Development==
[[File:Hironobu Sakaguchi - Tokyo Game Show 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Director, scenario co-designer and co-writer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] at the 2006 [[Tokyo Game Show]].]]
The initial concepts for ''The Last Story'' came to [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] after his departure from [[Square (company)|Square]] (now [[Square Enix]]) in 2003. After a period working on games at his new studio [[Mistwalker]], Sakaguchi realized that his style of game were not in tune with current gaming trends.&lt;ref name=&quot;IwataAsks1&quot;/&gt; Later, he elaborated that ''The Last Story'' was primarily born from reflecting on the design mistakes he made during the development of ''[[Blue Dragon (video game)|Blue Dragon]]'' (2006) and ''[[Lost Odyssey]]'' (2007): while they tried to innovate with the story, they kept the gameplay very traditional.&lt;ref name=&quot;1UPfamitsu&quot;/&gt; Sakaguchi drew up a design document for the game, and around that time met up with Takuya Matsumoto, a designer from [[AQ Interactive]] who had worked with Sakaguchi on ''Blue Dragon''. They both realized that they held the same views on what was holding their games back in the current market, and decided to collaborate on the game with the goal of creating something new.&lt;ref name=&quot;IwataAsks3&quot;/&gt; In an interview with [[IGN]], Sakaguchi said that development took three years: the first year was devoted to a trial-and-error development process devoted to the battle system.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNinterview&quot;/&gt; A longer development time of four years was reported by Matsumoto in a different interview with [[Gamasutra]]. According to Matsumoto, the team leads went to the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) each year and were assured that their game was in-step with current gameplay trends.&lt;ref name=&quot;GamaInterview&quot;/&gt; Production of ''The Last Story'' was a collaboration between Mistwalker, AQ Interactive and [[Nintendo]], and was Sakaguchi's first work as a director since ''[[Final Fantasy V]]'' (1992).&lt;ref name=&quot;IwataAsks1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CGV2&quot;/&gt; The game was going through its final development stages by April 2010, and according to Sakaguchi was &quot;complete&quot; by December that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastFinal1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LastFinal2&quot;/&gt;

Although Sakaguchi's previous RPGs from Mistwalker had been released for the [[Xbox 360]], ''The Last Story'' was created for the [[Wii]]. According to Sakaguchi, this was because Nintendo's Shinji Hatano shared their vision of a role-playing game that did not follow genre conversions, and so Sakaguchi accepted his offer of collaboration.&lt;ref name=&quot;CGV1&quot;/&gt; After being contacted regarding both ''The Last Story'' and fellow Wii ARPG ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]'', Hatano said that the games should be made for a wide audience and using a &quot;romanticist approach&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastStoryRomantic&quot;/&gt; When explaining why ''The Last Story'' was exclusive to the Wii, Sakaguchi said that it was because a large proportion of the late development staff, including the testers, came from Nintendo.&lt;ref name=&quot;AndriaTwitter&quot;/&gt; In a later interview, he said that working with the Wii, which did not use high-definition graphics, presented challenges as some of his ideas could not be implemented due to technical restrictions. Despite this, the team aimed to create a game that would look good when compared to games on high-definition consoles.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNinterview&quot;/&gt; Matsumoto stated that Nintendo had a strong influence on the game, which did not always sit well with him despite their suggestions ultimately improving the game. He also stated that Nintendo's creative and development aid in fine-tuning the game was the reason for its extended development.&lt;ref name=&quot;GamaInterview&quot;/&gt;

The basic story was conceived by Sakaguchi and Matsumoto, while the script was written by Sakaguchi, Masaru Hatano and Takatoshi Aoki.&lt;ref name=&quot;GamaInterview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LastWriters&quot;/&gt; The story was contributed to by multiple staff members, which sometimes annoyed Sakaguchi when they suggested something that would be out of character for one of the cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;IwataAsks3&quot;/&gt; According to Sakaguchi, the initial version featuring a science fiction storyline was &quot;shot down&quot; by Nintendo, forcing the team to begin all over again with a new setting and characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNinterview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LastLocal&quot;/&gt; Despite the story still using science fiction elements, the team worked to distance the setting from those elements by focusing on bright, natural colors for the environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNsetting&quot;/&gt; The biographies of the main cast were put together during the story's creation.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNinterview&quot;/&gt; Originally, according to Hatano, the game's theme was to have been the &quot;all-important drama that takes place between a man and a woman&quot;, but as development progressed it was changed to a theme of general companionship, although the original story remained the same.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastStoryRomantic&quot;/&gt; Hatano suggested incorporating dialogue into the gameplay rather than restricting it to cutscenes. This approach was inspired by both ''[[Uncharted]]'' and television series ''[[The West Wing]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GamaInterview&quot;/&gt; The concept was initially put forward as a joke about Zael's habit of kicking doors open, and how his companions would comment on how he always did this. After receiving positive feedback, they implemented it and kept in Zael's behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;IwataAsks3&quot;/&gt; Sakaguchi used this in-game dialogue to help convey the characters' personalities: as part of this, adlibs from the actors were included, and continual adjustments were made to the script. The characters' artwork also prompted Sakaguchi to make changes so the characters better fitted their presentation.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNinterview&quot;/&gt; The game's voiced dialogue was estimated at 12,000 lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastExclusive1&quot;/&gt; The option for players to skip through dialogue was a feature that Sakaguchi did not like, but he knew that some players would not like necessary long cutscenes, so gave them the option of going through them while still following the story. This meant that all the cutscenes needed to be done using the in-game engine rather than pre-rendered graphics.&lt;ref name=&quot;1UPfamitsu&quot;/&gt;

The characters were designed by Kimihiko Fujisaka. Fujisaka, who was acquainted with Sakaguchi, was brought on board the project at the beginning. At that point, only a simple plot outline had been created, and Sakaguchi showed this to Fujisaka and asked what he visualized from it. Due to this, Fujisaka had a lot of leeway in his designs. Due to Sakaguchi living in Hawaii while the game was being developed, Fujisaka was initially nervous about working with him on the project, but ultimately he found their working relationship to be a positive one. An aspect that worried Fujisaka during the early stages was the decision to have the characters able to change their clothing: their original appearances had been designed in relation to their lines, and while designing extra outfits proved difficult, he ultimately enjoyed the experience. Fujisaka also worked as a world designer, initially feeling restricted by the console's limited graphics. According to Fujisaka, the city hub began taking shape in 2009, relatively early in development. The world design he initially created was fairly bleak, but after Nintendo insisted on the scenario being changed, he redesigned it around a brighter fantasy aesthetic.&lt;ref name=&quot;IwataAsks1&quot;/&gt;

Developing the gameplay began at the start of development, with a test environment being built to develop and refine the basics of the battle system. Work within the test build spanned approximately one and a half years. While creating the battle system, the staff decided that the key words should be &quot;order&quot; and &quot;chaos&quot;: whoever gained order on the battlefield would be the victor. One of the concepts that emerged from this was Gathering, Zael's ability to direct all enemies' attention towards him. At first, Gathering ended up generating an unwanted amount of chaos on the battlefield, and this resulted in the trial-and-error period for it running on for a long time. The biggest challenge, once the concept had been finalized, was adjusting its effectiveness on the battlefield depending on the situation and enemy types.&lt;ref name=&quot;IwataAsks3&quot;/&gt; A concept that did not make it into the final game was &quot;Replay&quot;: after an enemy successfully cast a spell, players could rewatch the last few seconds of battle from an overhead view to see what type it was and take that into their strategy. This slowed the pace of combat down too much, so the concept was entirely removed. Hangovers of it include the ability to freeze time during certain actions, and the overhead perspective when commanding party members&lt;ref name=&quot;IwataAsks3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNinterview&quot;/&gt; The cover system was designed around the limitations of the camera control born from the Wii Remote's control scheme.&lt;ref name=&quot;VentureInterview&quot;/&gt;

Matsumoto was responsible for the level design. While preparing destructible elements within the environment, the staff took care that they could be easily recognized by the player. So as to create a more direct experience than other Japanese RPGs, the camera view was deliberately restricted around Zael, so the player would be kept within his point of view. A difficult part of development was balancing story and gameplay, which sometimes caused clashes between Sakaguchi and Matsumoto, as Matsumoto would upset the balance and necessitate Sakaguchi re-balancing it. The battle system and AI was refined by what Matsumoto described as &quot;chaotic battles royal between over 20 people wielding swords, magic and guns or ally command systems&quot;. The ability to fire projectiles had a big impact on the battle system's design.&lt;ref name=&quot;SilInterview&quot;/&gt; This concept was a hangover from the game's origins as a science fiction story.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastLocal&quot;/&gt; For the multiplayer, Sakaguchi avoided the potential for players to be rude to one-another by restricting their dialogue to segments from the single-player campaign. This was possible given the large amount of ambient dialogue in the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;CGV1&quot;/&gt;

The game's music was composed by [[Nobuo Uematsu]], a long-time collaborator with Sakaguchi who had worked on the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, ''Blue Dragon'' and ''Lost Odyssey''. Uematsu initially had a rough time: the first three pieces of music he sent were rejected, and then Uematsu did not respond for some time. Sakaguchi worried that Uematsu might quit the project altogether. In fact, Uematsu realized Sakaguchi's wishes for the title and had to rethink his approach entirely. With the second submission, Uematsu stated that he might leave if his music still did not fit, but it did and he remained as composer. In contrast to the majority of his earlier works, which made heavy use of purely melodic pieces and &quot;jogging music&quot;, Uematsu concentrated on a mixture between video game and film music to emphasize emotion and ambient sounds. He also worked to avoid creating signature jingles and fanfares. The most difficult pieces for him were battle tracks: the main battle theme was seven minutes long, but broken into small pieces that varied depending on situations and could be cued in depending on what was happening on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=&quot;CGV1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IwataAsks2&quot;/&gt; The game's theme song, {{nihongo|&quot;Toberu Mono&quot;|翔べるもの||lit. &quot;The Flying One&quot;}}, was composed by Uematsu with lyrics by Sakaguchi. Its lyrics are about the world someone is in not being where they are meant to be, with the phrase &quot;going home&quot; being used progressively through the song. According to Sakaguchi, the theme was quite personal for him, and also displays the &quot;foreignness&quot; of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNinterview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IwataAsks2&quot;/&gt;

==Release==
{{see also|Operation Rainfall}}
Sakaguchi revealed that he was working on a new game in July 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;MistNewgame&quot;/&gt; Initially targeted for a reveal that year, this was delayed for unknown reasons into 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;MistNewgameDelay&quot;/&gt; The game was announced by Nintendo in January 2010, alongside its platform and logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastRevealed&quot;/&gt; It was released on January 27, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;1UPfamitsu&quot;/&gt; Despite prompting interest from genre fans in the west since its official announcement, shortly before its Japanese release, Nintendo announced that ''The Last Story'' would remain exclusive to Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastExclusive1&quot;/&gt; Nintendo explained that the effort involved in bringing ''The Last Story'' overseas would be too much work on top of other important releases such as ''[[Kirby's Epic Yarn]]'' and titles for the [[Nintendo 3DS]]. Despite this, Nintendo stated that there was a strong possibility of it releasing in the United Kingdom due to its growing RPG market.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastExclusive2&quot;/&gt; It was officially announced for Europe in June 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;NinAnnounce&quot;/&gt; The European localization was handled by Nintendo of Europe, using the same team that had done ''Xenoblade Chronicles''. British voice actors were used for the dubbing, making use of various accents for the different characters. Some of the original programmers helped with the implementation of the localization, and it underwent unspecified adjustments.&lt;ref name=&quot;CGV2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LastVoicework&quot;/&gt; The game released in Europe on February 24, 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;SilEurope&quot;/&gt; It received a limited edition, featuring a CD with seven music tracks and an artbook.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastLimited&quot;/&gt; It was also released in Australia on February 23.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastAus&quot;/&gt;

After a continued lack of confirmation of a North American release, including it not being included in Nintendo's 2011 release schedule, a fan-based movement called [[Operation Rainfall]] started a campaign to raise awareness for ''The Last Story'', ''Xenoblade Chronicles'', and another Wii RPG titled ''[[Pandora's Tower]]''. This campaign included letter writing to Nintendo and petitions for its overseas release.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastMissing&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LastOperation&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DesRainfall&quot;/&gt; Despite acknowledging the effort, Nintendo stated that there were no plans for a North American release.&lt;ref name=&quot;Last1UP&quot;/&gt; Matsumoto was severely disappointed by this decision and thought ''The Last Story'' would never make it to North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;VentureInterview&quot;/&gt; At this point, [[Xseed Games]], who had developed a reputation for publishing niche Japanese games, took an interest in publishing the title. Initially approaching Nintendo in 2011, Nintendo confirmed that they had no plans to publish the title themselves. After playing through a Japanese copy of the game, and the staff were favorably impressed and decided to pitch to Nintendo for the game's North American publishing rights. They were helped by the connections between parent company AQ Interactive and Mistwalker. Xseed Games were the first publisher to ask Nintendo about ''The Last Story'', and after being favorably impressed by their proposal, Nintendo granted Xseed Games publishing rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;VentureInterview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KotakuXseed&quot;/&gt; While a new localization for North America was considered, it was decided to use Nintendo of Europe's localization as it better fitted the game's atmosphere and aesthetic.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastLocal&quot;/&gt; It officially released in North America on August 14, but problems with stock caused Amazon and GameStop to put orders on hold and push their release dates forward.&lt;ref name=&quot;LastNAShipping&quot;/&gt;

The story received mixed to positive reactions from critics. While they did not comment much on the story, ''[[Famitsu]]'' called ''The Last Story'' &quot;very classical RPG&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;FamReview&quot;/&gt; Eurogamer's Martin Robinson found the characters the most appealing part of the game, an opinion shared by Francesco Dagostino of [[1UP.com]], who particularly cited Syrenne's portrayal.&lt;ref name=&quot;1UPreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EuroReview&quot;/&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s Mark Walton shared this opinion while also praising the story's epic scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSreview&quot;/&gt; IGN's Keza MacDonald said that it presented a good story and characters within familiar themes and settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNreview&quot;/&gt; ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge Magazine]]'' found the story fairly traditional despite a strong cast and emotional power, while Matthew Castle of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' praised the effort made to flesh out the party members in side-missions despite referring to the main narrative as &quot;tedious&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CGVreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EdgeReview&quot;/&gt; [[GameTrailers]], while noting the familiar plotlines the game explored, said that ''The Last Story'' handled its plot better than others of its kind, praising its character development.&lt;ref name=&quot;GTreview&quot;/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'''s Joe Juba was fairly critical, finding the story overly predictable and the characters shallow. Jason Wishnov of [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] was also critical of the characters and plot, calling the former &quot;one-note&quot; despite convincing camaraderie and well-written in-game dialogue, and the latter impeded by problems with formulaic writing despite some late-game twists.&lt;ref name=&quot;G4review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GIreview&quot;/&gt; Simon Parkin, writing for ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'', found the characters likable despite a predictable story; ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' shared points of praise with other reviewers, in addition to praising Zael and Calista's romance, saying that it held the game together during some mid-game stumbles.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONMreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NGreview&quot;/&gt; RPGamer's Alex Fuller said that the story was great despite it using well-worn cliches.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGreview&quot;/&gt; Multiple critics gave high praise to the British-voiced localization.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GSreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EGMreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EuroReview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G4review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ONMreview&quot;/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Ultraman Nexus'''''|ウルトラマンネクサス|Urutoraman Nekusasu}} was produced by [[Tsuburaya Productions]], [[Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting]] (CBC), and [[Dentsu]]. It was the 20th entry in the [[Ultra Series]]. The series aired on [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]], including TBS, CBC, MBS, etc. The show ran from October 2, 2004 until June 25, 2005, with a total of 37 broadcast episodes. Subsequent DVD releases from [[Bandai Visual]] saw a brand new 45-minute Episode EX and an extended 45-minute Director's Cut of Episode 29.

On April 24, 2017, [[Toku (TV network)|Toku]] announced that the series will be broadcast in the United States on its channel beginning May 9, 2017 until June 2, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2017-04-24/toku-to-air-ultraman-nexus-live-action-series-with-english-subtitles/.115237|title=TOKU to Air Ultraman Nexus Live-Action Series With English Subtitles |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date= |accessdate=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2017/04/25-1/toku-channel-lines-up-ultraman-nexus|title=TOKU Channel Lines Up &quot;Ultraman Nexus&quot;|publisher=[[Crunchyroll]] |date= |accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{rewrite section|date=April 2013}}
Learning from the failure of the previous series, ''[[Ultraman Cosmos]]'' whose story is too childish so disliked teenagers upwards, ''Ultraman Nexus'' made with the concept of the story for mature audiences. This can be seen from the story out of the grip, that the person who can turn into Ultraman is not a person who joins the combat troops that always exist in each series, but the third person. Elements of drama and spice of love here and there between some of the characters are also given. Additionally, the mystery presented too complicated.

''Ultraman Nexus'' was part of Tsuburaya Productions' [[Ultra N Project]], an experiment in 2004 to re-invent Ultraman for a new generation of fans. Prior to this, however, Tsuburaya had begun a project called [[Ultra Collaboration 2]] at the end of 2003, which involved a brand new radio-adaptation of [[Ultra Q]] called ''[[The Ultra Q Club]]''. The project was also due to include a new TV series called ''Ultraman Noa'' in early 2004, which is presumably what ''Ultraman Nexus'' evolved into.{{Original research inline|date=January 2008}} Following the success of the new radio show, Tsuburaya forged ahead with a brand new season, [[Ultra Q: Dark Fantasy]] on April 6, 2004, a show which attracted top-rung directors such as [[Shusuke Kaneko]] (popular with fans for his work on the [[Gamera]] series and [[Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]]).

The first stage of the [[Ultra N Project]] was entitled ''Noa: Nostalgia''. The project mascot, Ultraman Noa, was a rather radical change design - an all-silver Ultraman with protruding wings on its back. Ultraman Noa was mainly used for live stage shows and merchandising. The second stage of the project was ''Next: Evolution''. This saw the creation of a new theatrical film, [[Ultraman (2004 film)|ULTRAMAN]]. The final stage was ''Nexus: Trinity'' - the piece that ties the entire project together. Unlike the previous series [[Ultraman Cosmos]], which was strictly aimed at young children, ''Ultraman Nexus'' was the first Ultraman TV series specifically aimed at adults. The show abandons the traditional monster-of-the-week stories in order to be replaced with longer character-based story arcs. Tsuburaya Productions had intended the show to be run during prime time, but the CBC network gave the show a 7:30 AM Saturday morning slot once [[Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon (live-action series)|Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon]] ended its 49-episode run. The TV series received weak ratings which were attributed to the change in style and not being able to have the target demographic tune in, resulting in the series being cut short from around 50 episodes down to 37.

Three months after its initial run, it was re-run in a new time slot. This time the show aired at 2:30 AM on Tuesday mornings and the ratings met the expectations that were set for the Ultra N Project. Following the ULTRAMAN movie, Tsuburaya ran a teaser trailer for [[Ultraman 2 Requiem]]. Due to the performance of ''Ultraman Nexus'' the film was canceled, and Tsuburaya moved ahead with a theatrical version of the then-current television series, ''[[Ultraman Mebius]]''.

Knowing that the Ultra N Project was intended to reboot the Ultra Series, it is worth noting that this is the third modern adaptation of Eiji Tsuburaya's Ultraman, with Ultraman Neos the second and [[Ultraman: The Ultimate Hero]] the first.

== Story ==
The TLT is a covert international anti-monster unit established secretly to combat Space Beasts, mysterious monsters that are out to attack humans in the year 2009. One of the TLT's new recruits, Komon Kazuki, is attacked by one of them prior to reporting for duty. However, he is saved by a silver giant that he names &quot;Ultraman&quot;. What no one knows is that the silver giant is ''an'' Ultraman—to be precise, Ultraman Nexus, ready to fight the Space Beasts to save the Earth.&lt;ref name=hicbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hicbc.com/tv/nexus |title=ウルトラマンネクサス |publisher=hicbc.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to all other Ultraman series story in a stand-alone episode, editors feel somewhat difficult to summarize the story Ultraman Nexus because in each episode there are important points that flows right into the next episode.

=== Nexus Junis with dunamist Jun Himeya (episode 1-24) ===
Kazuki Komon has just overtaken the work of the SAR team when recruited into the TLT. He just knew that during this time the earth is often attacked by SB, even the existence of SB and the existence of TLT itself is very secret. On the way, he found the bus parked empty. Passengers disappeared because of SB, Komon was almost killed if only a silver giant did not help him. Komon was amazed. Meanwhile, Nagi Saijyou from the NR team in charge of eradicating SB in a tunnel meets the figure of a mysterious man. He thought it was just his faulty eyesight but he turned out to meet the man again when he came face-to-face with SB one afternoon.

Komon himself trained to be a formidable NR agent under Shiori Hiraki's help until finally he went on a mission. Before NR succeeded in destroying the giant SB, came the giant who first confronted him. The giant is the giant who helped Komon yesterday, so Komon thinks the giant is on their side. But NR argues otherwise, they shoot the giant who later named Ultraman it. SB has not been defeated while Ultraman was wounded and disappeared, and NR took the initiative to find them. Nagi and Komon who are in charge of searching Ultraman while others are looking for SB. Nagi and Komon find the man with the same wound as Ultraman. The same man who always looked. Nagi intends to kill the man but the man calls a UFO and can run away. Previously, Komon had touched the UFO. When he was stunned, he saw the man's past. He saw the mood of the battlefield, a girl called out a name and when she met the man she called, the girl was killed when she intended to approach him.

Nagi lies to Captain Eisuke Wakura that he meets Ultraman in a human figure, while Komon searches for his identity on the internet and finds the same photographs and names in his memory, his photographer named Jun Himeya. Komon went to the newspaper office that contains the photo Himeya was no longer working there but he met someone who knew Himeya named Megumi Sakuta. Himeya's pathetic past is told by Sakuta. Himeya lost a girl named Sera. The Komon is increasingly convinced that Himeya is not a bad person as Nagi thinks, but still they continue to disagree. On the other hand, Himeya comes Jizou Negoro, a long-time friend of a journalist, who insists on bringing Himeya to work again and investigate. His investigation led him to engage with the TLT and make him pursued by the MP.

Also told that Komon has a lover named Riko Saida, they often dating at the zoo. Komon often miss Riko while working especially if he's been disagreeing with Nagi. The NR team again has to deal with SB this time at a factory, Himeya also catches up with them but instead sees Ultraman who claims to be a shadow of himself, and introduces himself as Faust. Himeya changed as Nexus and fight Faust but Faust disappeared and said just test it. At the same time, the NRs with their own powers are able to finish off a giant SB. Faust increasingly appeared, and Riko began to feel something strange with his body. Komon was surprised to see that one day Riko was wounded in the woods and carried Nagi's relics. In addition, the figure of the person who claimed to be the cruel game maker also appeared. He was named Mizorogi Shinya. Komon wondered why his colleagues at NR reacted strangely to the name, especially Nagi.

MP intends to erase Riko's memory for allegedly seeing the SB, but Riko disappears from the hospital. I am Shuto who is looking for him to find the shocking fact that Riko's family including the list of victims killed by SB. Meanwhile, Komon who worries about Riko goes to his apartment and is surprised to see Riko's room full of horrible pictures, he also meets Faust and again pinned Himeya. For the first time Komon sees Himeya changing. Apparently Riko was the dunamist of Faust, and he was resurrected by Mizorogi. Komon accidentally entered in darkfield, and he who can not stand to see Nexus lose shot Faust. Mizorogi had told SB to kill Komon but Faust was injured protecting him. Riko died in Komon's arms. Komon was then shocked and used by Mizorogi to control his weak heart. Nagi also influenced Komon to hate SB who killed Riko to make him stronger. Himeya then recounts her bitter past experiences and how she got the power of light to help the Komon rise from the sadness. Unable to bear with all that, Komon decided to better erase his memory. He was saved Negoro when the MP met him, Negoro who originally intended to extract info about Himeya and the TLT even helped Komon realize that it is wrong. Again Mizorogi appears and creates Riko in Komon's mind. At that precarious moment, Himeya came back and fought with the Mizorogi who turned into Dark Mephisto. Komon did not become captivated by darkness. He who remembers Himeya's advice has finally decided to continue fighting for the likes of Riko.

The Komon survived the Mizorogi, but Nagi did not return to the base. Komon also had the opportunity to ask Captain Wakura about the relationship between Nagi and Mizorogi. Formerly, Mizorogi was vice-captain of the NR. Nagi greatly idolizes the most famous Mizorogi in NR in order to learn from him how to defeat SB. Mizorogi also teaches a variety of special intensive exercises only two, in line with the growing feelings of love between the two. Nagi who hates SB is of course felt betrayed to see the person he loved then side with the darkness (SB). Apparently at the same time, Mizorogi is planning to invite Nagi to his side. Komon and Captain Wakura thankfully not too late, so did Himeya. This is the first time Captain Wakura knows Himeya is Ultraman. Mizorogi called SB to fight Nexus. Nagi who consciously shot Mizorogi and darkfield disappeared.

Himeya who was injured then again must immediately fight with the SB that appears in the mountains. Nagi, Captain Wakura, and Komon directly join Shiori and Ishibori who are already alerted there. This time the opposed SB has the ability to disappear, it takes 3 episodes to defeat him. Her unconscious Himeya was rescued by Horokusa and two friends who happened to be busy photographing nearby. Horokusa who is still an amateur photographer recognizes and idolizes Himeya. When SB rages back, he thought Himeya fainted while taking a picture. Horokusa took the initiative to replace him, he managed to take a lot of pictures but killed SB eaten in front of his friends. When the morning before and Nexus managed to defeat SB tsb, Negoro who is looking for Himeya take Horokusa camera from his friend. Himeya who listened to their conversation realized that Horokusa's actions were like him when he wanted to capture the moment of war, but he had forgotten the reason because his guilt over Sera's death was too great. While Negoro publishes it in newspapers and meets with UFO fan clubs that help him hide from the pursuit of MP, Himeya is severely wounded by the TLT under orders Yoichiru Matsunaga.

Himeya's body was taken to the experimental room just like Komon used to undergo a medical test. Yoichiru intends to find out the origin of Ultraman's power and how to get it to strengthen the TLT weapon. Himeya's heart had stopped beating before Yu knew how to revive it. At that moment, Himeya runs away and meets Komon in the hallway. Yu warns Himeya that if he continues to fight in that condition, he will be killed. Himeya ignores Yu's warnings and makes Komon anxious. Himeya herself ran away until she met Sakuta in a park where they usually met. On the other hand, the Mizorogis again do evil deeds. He intends to open a portal of darkness that connects the Land of Death with the earth to bring more SB, but it takes the energy of light belonging to Nexus to be changed in the dark energy in a ritual. Seeing Sakuta who is very concerned about Himeya, Mizorogi keeps Himeya from Sakuta by summoning SB and when Himeya goes that he kidnaps Sakuta.

NR is not left behind, with information from Yu and analysis from Ishibori, they find the point where the portal will be opened. In fact, Negoro with his journalist instincts also headed there. He almost killed SB if Himeya did not help him. Himeya who realizes his body is on the verge of border does not want to see again to see the people closest to him, like Sakuta and Negoro, were killed. He also took the risk and it's true he was not strong again facing the SB that Mizorogi prepared in the land of death. As Strike Chester arrives, NR sees the helpless Nexus crucified on a rock where the death ritual will begin. They also face SB, and with a new weapon named Ultimate Vanisher obtained from the experimental results of Himeya's body, NR was able to destroy the SB page. However, they were unable to fight the Mizorogi any more because he held Sakuta hostage. Himeya who met Sera in her unconscious made her able to rise. However, he again became a monster of Mephisto. Yu ordered the Komon to shoot right at the Nexus energy core with the light that once turned Himeya back on. Although initially hesitant, Komon did so. Nexus is now able to keep up with Mephisto. Seeing Mephisto difficult to conquer, Nexus launched a suicide attack and exploded together. All who see it can only startled. Komon cried, could not believe his friend was gone. Himeya pops up briefly as a ghost in front of Komon and leaves a message that keeps her always ringing in her head. The message is &quot;Hikari wa Kizuna ...&quot;.

After the big battle, NR was interrogated one by one by the highest TLT-Japan board on Ultraman and Himeya Jun's identity and the reason they always helped him. While continuing to try to interpret Himeya's message, Komon and his friends fight back against SB. Turns out Ultimate Vanisher can not be used anymore. Yu tells Yuichiro if it's because someone has just hacked their database and deleted the Himeya file. NR is overwhelmed with surprise by the appearance of the blue Nexus. Yu tells them that it's no longer Himeya.

=== Nexus Junis Blue with dunamist Ren Senjyu (episode 26-36) ===
Ren Senjyu is a hyperactive young man who works part-time in a playground. Cheerful, familiar with small children, and very smart. He has the ability of supernatural ability and able to see the incident overnight just by touching the asphalt, saw the action of MP who was currently erasing the memory of people, exactly the actions of agents Mizuo Nonomiya. Mizuo himself was ordered to spy on Ren by Yoichiro, but they fell in love. Meanwhile, Ren realizes that all this time he was always photographed by strangers.

Ren meets with Ultraman as soon as Himeya dies, and appears surprisingly in front of Komon and his friends. While protecting Chester, Nexus was injured on the right shoulder. Komon thinks Himeya is still alive and intends to look for him. He saw Ren running fast in the place of the fall of Ultraman. Komon follows him until he gets inside Ren's house. However, he was ambushed Ren because Komon suspected as the person who had been after him. Suddenly Ren fainted. When Komon sees the same wound as the Nexus, he realizes that Ren is the new Nexus dunamist. Komon also treats Ren's wound and asks permission not to work on Harisu, Ren's boss, by claiming to be his cousin. Komon and Ren became close. The curious Komon with Ren searches for his origin through the network at TLT and learns that Ren is the child of Prometheus Project (PP), the same as Illustrator. In addition, it turns out the Mizorogi managed to escape the dead living battle against Himeya in the Land of death. During this time he kept hidden and one day he rescued the little girl whose parents had been killed by him.

Behind the deep remorse, Mizorogi remembers that he is like a doll of even greater strength. He was the same as Riko. Mizorogi was arrested TLT, but before his body was researched like Himeya, he escaped with captivating Mizuo so MP was also chasing him, one of which is Misawa agent. Though held captive, Mizuo sympathizes with Mizorogi and wants to hear the boy's voice. When they meet Komon and Nagi who want to save him, he instead protects Mizorogi. However, Mizorogi's chest was shot by Misawa who was apparently capable of turning into Mephisto (Zwei). Mizorogi lost his power because his dunamist moved. Ren also appears because he is worried about Mizuo, but he is pressed by Mephisto. The mizorogi filled with his regretfulness who also did not want to die in vain as a criminal made him gain the power of light and changed once again into Mephisto this time to help the Nexus. Nexus succeeds in destroying Mephisto Zwei, a deeply wounded Mizorogi who died peacefully in Nagi's arms that finally forgave him. Before exhaling, he briefly informed Nagi that the person who actually controlled him (Unknown Hand) was inside the TLT but did not know who exactly.

Stories are progressing fast. Junis Blue's first appearance as a change in the new Nexus form was marked by a change of dunamist from Himeya to Ren, and followed by the emergence of new and increasingly powerful opponents. Ren trouble to make Metafield because there are other forces that turn it into darkfield and increase the strength of SB. Even the SB that was opposed was SB-SB which had been destroyed by Himeya and NR before. In addition, a large hole of darkness which was then given the code name Unknown Hand also heal the SB wound pinned by Chester and Nexus. In fact, even the fighting ultimately into the city where humans can watch it. The city was plagued by panic and the TLT had to work hard. Meanwhile, Unknown Hand infiltrated the secret area located at the base of the base. In the midst of such a precarious situation, an agent from TLT USA, Sara Mizuhara, was with his partner professor Kaimoto. From his talks with the highest council of TLT, revealed a secret five years ago in Shinjuku where the Ultraman fighting against the first SB and causing the death toll of 640 people. During this time, people's memory of the incident has been removed using Lethe, an extraterrestrial technology that fell 20 years ago in Colorado (the same meteor as UFO fan clubs told Negoro). People's memory is stored in the Sea of Forgetfulness stored in the forbidden area. Meanwhile, NR is curious about the arrival of Sara, assisted by computer-savvy Ishibori, discovered a secret file 5 years ago. They were also surprised because they themselves have never remembered the incident. Out of protest, Captain Wakura begged Sara to explain it. Sara went home to the United States, and Kaimoto stayed at TLT Japan to watch for Ren.

Ren's life is colorful, he always teases Mizuo, becomes a clown in the playground, plays with Komon during his free comon, and jokes with Ojiro, his fellow partimer. The four of them passed the dinner together invited by the day. In addition, with his ESP he was able to communicate with Yuu who was also a good college. Behind his cheerful nature, Ren did not have longevity. He was diagnosed with a kind of illness due to an impact that should not affect the children of PP and can only survive with a special drug called Raphael. Feeling confined by the academy rules that accommodate the children of PP, when he has not seen the outside world and his age is not long anymore, Ren also fled to Japan. That's what kept him watched by the TLT from the start. Until one day TLT finds out that Ren is a dunamist and after a grueling battle, just like Himeya, Ren is kidnapped will be scrutinized to make Ultimate Vanisher again. Mizuo tells Komon and Komon to immediately appeal to all his colleagues in NR to rescue Ren. They managed to escape with Ren after sabotaging the TLT. The battle became heavier, Ren's body quickly reached the limit of endurance. He who feels already on the verge of death, determined to spend the rest of his life by fighting as Ultraman. Komon then told Ren about the previous dunamist, he did not want Ren to suffer the same and died like Himeya. SB again attacked, this time is a combination of all the SB ever. At that time, Yuu is also worried about Ren's body condition through Komon's Pulse Breaker that Raphael has been imported by Prof. Kaimoto. However, Ren feels he can not waste time to go to the hospital first, he also greet Mizuo and fought all out. Ren wins but is dying, but survived by Raphael's drug intervention. The Light leaves Ren, Deunamist moved once again.

=== Ultraman Noa with dunamist Kazuki Komon (episode 37) ===
The story ends in episode 37, with the appearance of Dark Zagi ever mentioned by Mizorogi in the TLT. His Dunamist turned out to be Ishibori, his past being expressed here. In addition, it is not explained further why Nagi suddenly acquired the evoltruster. Then because his emotions were hooked by Ishibori who claimed to kill his parents and only made the Mizorogi as a tool, Nagi turned into Ultraman inside the weakened Lethe area so that his power was immediately absorbed by Ishibori to transform into Dark Zagi. Dark Zagi then rampaged in the city while chased by Captain Wakura alone with Chrome Chester, while his other men Shiori did not move after being shot Ishibori and Komon helped Nagi. Finally Komon takes over the dunamist, feels he has successfully interpreted Himeya's heritage words, and transforms into Ultraman Noa to defeat Zagi. This series leaves a hanging end because it turns out after Zagi die too SB is still emerging. But this time the TLT confronted them without any further buzz from the public, followed by a closing narrative of the Komon.

===TLT (Terrestrial Liberation Trust)===

The {{nihongo|'''Terrestrial Liberation Trust'''|地球解放機構|Chikyū Kaihō Kikō}} or {{nihongo|TLT|ティルト|Tiruto}} is a top secret global, non-government organization set up to investigate, research and defeat the {{nihongo|'''&quot;Space Beast'''&quot;|スペースビースト|Supēsu Bīsuto}} threat. Japan’s TLT (TLT-J) branch is hidden under a hydroelectric dam found in the mountainous Kanto region (eastern Japan). The main teams of TLT are the Night Raiders, Memory Police (who erase the memories of civilians involved in any Night Raider missions or witnessing any Space Beast attacks) and White Sweeper, who are involved in clean-up.

===Night Raiders===
{{nihongo|Night Raiders|ナイトレイダー|Naito Reidā}} is the elite defense team united under TLT. The team responsible in eliminating Space Beasts.
*{{nihongo|'''Kazuki Komon'''|孤門 一輝|Komon Kazuki}} &lt;br&gt; [[Ultraman Nexus (character)#Kazuki Komon|see here]]
*{{nihongo|'''Nagi Saijyo'''|西条 凪|Saijō Nagi}} &lt;br&gt; [[Ultraman Nexus (character)#Nagi Saijyo|see here]]
*{{nihongo|'''Eisuke Wakura'''|和倉 英輔|Wakura Eisuke}} &lt;br&gt; The captain of the Night Raiders. He is a good leader and takes action effectively in any situation. He cares for his teammates and is well trusted by them. Although his motto is to follow orders, he will take necessary action if it means to protect others. He is a brother figure towards Komon who provides wisdom to the new recruit.&lt;ref name=hicbc /&gt;
*{{nihongo|'''Shiori Hiraki'''|平木 詩織|Hiraki Shiori}} &lt;br&gt; A female in the Night Raider team. Although she looks pretty and cute, she is an expert in weapons and can be very strong and helpful during missions. She has a good personal relationship with Mitsuhiko Ishibori. After Nagi becomes the fourth Dunamist in the final episode, Shiori is shot by Ishibori when he reveals himself as Dark Zagi to the team, but is later shown defending people with rest of the Night Raiders from Beasts in the closing scenes of the series.&lt;ref name=hicbc /&gt;
*{{nihongo|'''Mitsuhiko Ishibori'''|石堀 光彦|Ishibori Mitsuhiko}} &lt;br&gt; The analyzer and tactician of the team and an expert in computers.&lt;ref name=hicbc /&gt; Unknown to everyone, he is Dark Zagi in disguise (see below). 18 years ago, Dark Zagi, in the form of a blue light similar to The One, possessed a man called Hajime Yamaoka to use him to execute his plan. First, he killed Nagi's mother to plant hatred into Nagi's heart. Then, he joined the Night Raiders so that he could see the progress of the plan more easily. Then, he used Mizorogi and Riko to deepen the hatred of Nagi and plant hopelessness into Komon's heart (this failed thanks to Himeya). Then, when Mizorogi is defeated, he deleted the data of the Ultraman to render the destructive beam useless. Finally, when Nagi became a Dunamist, every part of his plan come into place: the hatred of Nagi and the fear of Lethe towards Dark Zagi have resonated and turned all of the light of Ultraman Nexus into darkness, making the reviving of Dark Zagi successful.

===The Dunamists===
{{nihongo|Dunamists|デュナミスト|Dyunamisuto}} are humans who can bond with the Light to become Ultraman Nexus, using a wand-like device called the {{nihongo|Evoltruster|エボルトラスター|Eborutorasutā}}.

It was later revealed that she had actually died at the day she met Komon, when her family was attacked by the Space Beast Nosferu. Mizorogi arrived on the scene, but turned around and shot her instead. She was resurrected to become a pawn of the darkness, unwittingly serving as the human host for Dark Faust, Nexus' first enemy. However, in the end, Riko's consciousness won out during a battle with Nosferu where Komon became trapped in the Meta Field, and she shielded him with his/her body against an attack. The revelation that Riko was Faust and her demise shocked Komon considerably, and he took a long time to recover.

In reality, Mizorogi had merged with the Dark Giant known as ''Dark Mephisto''. He is portrayed as cruel and manipulative, playing mind games with Komon and other people and seeming to take delight in antagonizing Nagi, his ex-girlfriend, as well. Using the Dark Evolver, Mizorogi can transform into Dark Mephisto as the most frequently appearing enemy of Nexus. Dark Mephisto is able to generate the Dark Field, which neutralizes the effects of the Meta Field and gives him an advantage in battle. In Nexus' climactic battle with Mephisto, it is presumed that both perished, but Mizorogi is found alive, although wounded and with absolutely no memory about Faust and his battles with Nexus. Eventually he discovers that he has been nothing but a pawn himself, manipulated by the Unknown Hand to become Dark Mephisto just as he manipulated Riko to become Dark Faust.  He had also lost the ability to become Mephisto, but when the Unknown Hand sends down Dark Mephisto Zwei against Junis Blue, Mizorogi gets his chance at redemption, transforming by force of will back to Mephisto, and holds Zwei down so that Nexus can destroy him. Both Mephistos perished, and Shinya dies in Nagi's arms, and he reminded her that the traitor (Dark Zagi) is among them.

He has the same powers as Dark Mephisto and only differs in eye color with Zwei being red instead of black. Thanks to the interference of the original Dark Mephisto, now on the side of good, Zwei is destroyed by Nexus.
*{{nihongo|'''Unknown Hand'''|アンノウンハンド|An'nōn Hando}} &lt;br&gt; It is described as the unlimited darkness which controlled the Dark Giants and Space Beasts behind the scenes. It has the ability to generate a Dark Field G and it can power up Space Beasts. In the end of the series, its identity was revealed as {{nihongo|Dark Zagi|ダークザギ|Dāku Zagi}}, Mitsuhiko Ishibori of the Night Raiders. Dark Zagi eventually took his true form and assaulted the city before being confronted by Nexus. While Zagi was able to hold off Nexus' physical attacks and even deflect all his finishing attacks with his bare hands, Ultraman Nexus eventually evolves into Ultraman Noa. Noa proves to be too powerful for Dark Zagi to contend with and Zagi is literally blasted into space. Noa fires his Lightning Noa attack and Zagi attempts to counter with his own beam but is overpowered and finally killed in a huge explosion.

{{nihongo|'''''Infection'''''|感染|Kansen}} is a 2004 Japanese [[horror film]] directed by [[Masayuki Ochiai]]. The film is about a run-down hospital where a doctor's mistake unwittingly creates horrific consequences for the staff at the hospital. The film was adapted from Ochiai's earlier screenplay from ''Tales of the Unusual''. On its release, the film was part of the six-volume ''[[J-Horror Theater]]'' series.

On the films release in Japan, it was the second highest gross film at the weekend box office, only being beaten by the film ''[[I, Robot (film)|I Robot]]''.

==Plot==
At a run down, understaffed hospital, Dr. Akiba refuses to admit a patient with a strange black rash and is alerted to a serious crisis in Room 3 where a burn victim has died, having apparently been given the wrong drug. Akiba, another doctor, and four nurses decide to cover up the cause of death and move the body to an unused room. Akiba then discovers that the patient he refused to admit has been left in the hallway. Doctor Akai decides to study his symptoms: though he is still alive, his body mass is liquefying into green goo. Not knowing how much Akai knows about the events in Room 3, Akiba and the others reluctantly agree to help with the examination but when they return to the patient's room, they find he has vanished and the head nurse has been knocked unconscious.

The doctors find that they are risk of infection, when the head nurse begins to bleed green goo from both her ears and eyes. The doctors put her on a bed and cover her with plastic in an attempt to limit the infection's spread. 
Soon after, the mean nurse finds the young nurse drawing blood on herself. Their conversation goes awry, when the young nurse lets out a manic laugh and plunges two needles into her body, splattering the nurse with green goo.
While speaking with a patient he killed earlier, Uozumi is overcome with guilt and starts crying. Akiba walks in, but finds Uozumi alone. His eyes turn white and green goo starts seeping from him. Akiba panics and turns to find a nurse, now infected and covered in green goo, smiling and hanging upside down from the ceiling. After finding the nurse giving her own blood to the dead burn patient and running into the infected head nurse, Akiba flees the room.

Akiba confronts Akai and accuses him of creating and spreading the virus. Akai denies this and explains that the infection is actually spread mentally, infecting the [[subconscious]] of its victims. He then urges Akiba to remember what really happened in Room 3 earlier in the night. Dr. Nakazono walks in to find Akiba talking to himself, forcing him to realize that he's been speaking with his reflection. He looks around and sees the corpses of the two nurses who are dead and covered in blood with no green goo in sight. Soon, Dr. Nakazono realizes that the last few hours have all been a hallucination. Nakazono calls the police, as Akiba recalls the events in Room 3 and realizes that &quot;Akai&quot; was actually the burn patient. The same series of events is shown again, but with Akiba as the burn patient and Akai as Akiba, giving the order for the wrong drug, which massacres the entire staff.

The hospital is evacuated the next morning as all of the staff, except Nakazono, are dead and the police is searching for Akiba who has disappeared. When Nakazono leaves the hospital, she sees all the red lights change to green and vice versa; panicking, she accidentally cuts her hand and green blood pours out. A shot of a locker is seen in the room where the burn victim was kept. Someone inside the locker is calling for help as green goo starts pouring out of it. The top of the locker opens and Akiba's hand covered in goo reaches out before falling to the floor.

==Reception==
''[[The Japan Times]]'' stated that ''Infection'' will &quot;look familiar to J Horror fans&quot; and resembled an episodes of ''[[The X-Files]]'' without Scully and Mulder.&lt;ref name=&quot;japantimes&quot; /&gt; The review concluded that the director &quot;stresses [[Grand Guignol]] atmospherics more, rational-sounding explanations less. His hospital breathes with a menace, madness and despair so pervasive that only a huge, obliterating explosion could bring escape -- in this life, at least.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;japantimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050415095727/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/print/features/film2004/ff20041006a1.htm|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/print/features/film2004/ff20041006a1.htm|accessdate=April 27, 2016|archivedate=April 15, 2005|last=Schilling|first=Mark|title=Be Doubly Afraid|work=[[The Japan Times]]|date=October 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Kalat (''[[Video Watchdog]]'') referred to the film as &quot;a claustrophobic chamber piece&quot; and &quot;an overwhelming sensory experience that employs every cinematic trick in Ochiai's repertoire to establish a tone of intense dread.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Video Watchdog]]|title=Infection|year=2006|issue=124|page=51|last=Kalat|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' gave the film a mixed review, opining that &quot;after a fairly engrossing trawl through horror conventions, the film takes a reckless plunge into oneiric ambiguity that fails to provide satisfying closure&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Sight &amp; Sound]]|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|title=Infection|last=Leyland|first=Matthew|volume=16|issue=12|page=89|date=December 2006|ISSN=0037-4806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Kaidan'''''|怪談|Kaidan}} is a 2007 [[Japanese horror|Japanese horror film]], directed by [[Hideo Nakata]], of two young people who fall in love, but are haunted by the ghost of a murdered moneylender who seeks revenge, which leaves a lasting effect on the couple.

==Plot==
Oshiga (Kuroki) and Osono are sisters whose father was killed by Shinzaemon, Shinkichi's samurai father, due to a debt dispute. Upon his death, Oshiga and Osono's father vowed revenge for his wrongful murder. His body is dumped in a mysterious lake that's believed to be cursed and haunted by a woman, who was wrongfully killed by her husband many years ago. Shortly after, Shinzaemon kills his wife and himself, leaving their baby, Shinkichi, orphaned and in care of his uncle.

Years later, Oshiga, now a respected teacher who runs a school for young girls in [[Edo]], falls in love with a young tobacco vendor named Shinkichi (Kunoemon Oroe), who lives with his uncle. Shinkichi and Oshiga decide to live together as husband and wife, but Shinkichi begins flirting with the school's students, especially Oisa. Miserable and invidious, Oshiga becomes mean to the students, who leave one by one.

Oshiga quarrels with Osono, who doesn't approve Oshiga's relationship with Shinkichi, prompting her to run away. Shinkichi admonishes Oshiga and declares he wants to end their relationship. She pleads with him not to leave. During this quarrel, Shinkichi accidentally wounds his wife with her [[shamisen]]'s ''[[bachi]]'' against her left brow. They reconcile, but Oshiga slowly falls ill from her wound. At a festival, Oshiga's former student Oisa meets Shinkichi, who is there to buy medicine for Oshiga, and they rent a hotel room. There he promises to run away with her. He then goes to his uncle's house to find that Oshiga is waiting for him and states that he can leave but asks him to promise to stay by her side when she dies.

Oshiga meanwhile dies and is given a proper burial. Shinkichi discovers in a letter, left by Oshiga, that warns if he remarries, she will haunt his new wife until the latter dies. He and Oisa elope and flee the city, but they lose their way in the rain. Oshiga's [[vengeful spirit]] terrorises the pair until she makes a frightful apparition to her husband. Out of fearful defense, he strikes her with a [[kama (weapon)|scythe]] and to his horror, he realises he's stuck it into Oisa's neck. He passes out on the road.

He wakes up in the house of a wealthy man. They discover Oisa's corpse, prompting Shinkichi to run away to Hanyo  where he encounters Osono, Oshiga's sister. Osono and Shinkichi mourn the death of Oshiga, and Osono soon finds her former brother-in-law a job. He gives her a small bell as a present. Soon, he's referred as the master of the house. The wealthy man and his wife want Shinkichi to marry their daughter Orui, Oisa's cousin. Shinkichi initially declines. After a blue snake attacks Orui, causing her against a fireplace and Shinkichi notices Orui's burn is in the same place as Oshiga's scar. He hastily agrees to marry Orui.

Shinkichi and Orui soon have a daughter, who's born unusually pale with a scar on her left brow. The child eventually displays strange characteristics, which troubles Shinkichi.

{{Nihongo|'''''Kyōfu'''''|恐怖}} A.K.A. '''''The Sylvian Experiments''''' is a 2010 Japanese horror film, directed by [[Hiroshi Takahashi (screenwriter)|Hiroshi Takahashi]] who is known as a screenwriter of ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]''. It was released on 10 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_c.php?num_c=336550|script-title=ja:映画 恐怖|accessdate=2015-06-13|publisher=Stingray|work=allcinema|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mynavi.jp/articles/2010/12/20/takakyoufu/|script-title=ja:『リング』、『女優霊』の脚本でJホラー像を確立した高橋洋監督の『恐怖』|accessdate=2015-06-13|work=mynavi.jp|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Two [[neurosurgeons]], Etsuko Ōta and her husband, Yukio, watch a [[16mm film|16mm]] [[documentary film]] of a secret experiment with [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Manchu people|Manchu]], and [[Russians|Russian]] subjects concerning the electrification of the [[temporal lobe]] of the brain, ending with the subjects projecting a blinding white light. Their children, Miyuki and Kaori, watch the film as well. Years later, a group consisting of Miyuki, Kazushi, Takumi and Rieko, conduct a mass suicide assisted by Etsuko's assistant, Hattori, though it is actually a masquerade for their initiation to a similar neurosurgery experiment conducted by Etsuko. Miyuki wakes up inside a facility to another of Etsuko's assistants, Hisae, who insists that she has died and is currently [[astral projecting]], even presenting her with her corpse as proof. Miyuki and Rieko are later found to have escaped the facility unnoticed.

After having lost contact with her sister for six months, Kaori visits the hospital where Miyuki once worked and meets with Miyuki's fellow worker and lover, Motojima, who introduces her to Detective Hirasawa. Miyuki's laptop contains a suicide website that Miyuki might have used. Hirasawa questions a witness who saw a figure inside Miyuki's apartment after her disappearance. Kaori realizes that she has dreamed of being in Miyuki's apartment and seeing a white light nearby. Miyuki visits Kaori in a dream that night to tell her to stop looking for her and that she is &quot;no longer her sister&quot;. Kaori is confronted by Etsuko and taken to the facility to learn about the experiment. Kazushi and Takumi have long since died, unable to contain the experiment. Witnessing how Miyuki has bended realities around her since the experiment, Etsuko conducts the experiment on herself and Kaori, revealing that she and Yukio have always wanted to know the &quot;true&quot; reality beyond the current one to achieve a [[spiritual evolution]], and the film had provided them with the means to it. However, she stops the experiment just when Kaori sees a young Miyuki and herself staring at the white light, apparently because Kaori would have been consumed by it.

The next day, Kaori tells Motojima that her father committed suicide following a neurosurgery failure, while her mother is a skeptic of the [[afterlife]], and believes that there is [[Mu (negative)|nothing after death]]. The two visit Kaori's childhood home and meet with an ethereal Miyuki. It is revealed that Motojima was the one who informed Miyuki of the suicide website and has been in league with Etsuko, who tracks the sisters and kills Hirasawa. All of them go back to the facility with Rieko, now pregnant despite being a virgin. Motojima reveals that Miyuki's corpse is actually a [[hologram]] meant to fool her and the other three subjects and she is still very much alive. Motojima shows the film to Kaori and Miyuki, with Etsuko explaining that the white light actually projects what the viewer is dreaming. Yukio wanted to further the spiritual evolution, so the light &quot;followed&quot; him back in reality until he could not take it anymore and killed himself. However, Rieko is suicidal and wants nothing more, so the light impregnated her with the &quot;afterlife&quot;, i.e. nothing. Rieko gives birth to the &quot;afterlife&quot;, who consumes Hattori and Motojima, while Etsuko is consumed when she experiments herself as well. At the forest, Kaori and Miyuki walk together until Kaori realizes that Miyuki had &quot;died&quot; long ago when she found that she could not fit herself with the world and runs away from her sister.

The film closes with an alive Hirasawa inspecting the bodies of Miyuki, Kazushi, Takumi, Rieko, and Hattori and Kaori lamenting of remains on the ground.

{{nihongo|'''''Reincarnation'''''|輪廻|Rinne}} is a 2005 [[Japanese horror]] film, directed by [[Takashi Shimizu]]. It centers on a hopeful actress who won a role in a film that takes her, the cast, and the crew to a hotel where the present soon collides with the past. 

It was released as a part of the six-volume [[J-Horror Theater]].

==Plot==
A number of people see visions apparently dead people: a businessman finds one behind him in an elevator. A truck driver runs over one on the road only to be shocked when he investigates the body as the opening credits start.

Professor Norihasa Omori (Atsushi Haruta) visits a local hotel and films himself killing eleven of the hotel guests, employees, his own children before committing suicide, all as part of his wish to understand [[reincarnation]]. Since then, the footage of the murders disappears. Thirty-five years later, horror movie director Ikuo Matsumura (Kippei Shiina) decides to make a film about the massacre. As the date of the shoot draws near, Nagisa Sugiura ([[Yūka (actress)|Yūka]]), the actress who is set to star as Omori's daughter Chisato (Mao Sasaki), is haunted by the [[ghost]]s of the victims. She begins hallucinating and is plagued by nightmares of the killings. She discovers an old film camera which will later be revealed to be the same type the professor used.

Yayoi Kinoshita ([[Karina Nose]]) wakes up in the middle of a psychology class, in which the professor publicly opposes the ideas of reincarnation and [[cryptomnesia]]. She decides to write an essay supporting cryptomnesia and meets Yuka Morita ([[Marika Matsumoto]]), an actress who auditioned for Ikuo's movie. Yuka says she remembers things in a &quot;past life&quot; of hers and shows Yayoi a [[birthmark]] that would appear to be evidence of strangulation, which reveals that she has the same vision as Nagisa. Yayoi and Yuka check out the college library, but ghosts of the dead appear to drag Yuka up and away. Yayoi's research takes her to the only survivor of the attack: Ayumi Omori (Miki Sanjo), the professor's wife. She explains that while many thought he had lost his mind, he had become obsessed that the body is only a vessel.

During filming Nagisa begins to believe that she is the reincarnation of Chisato Omori as she seems to slip into another hallucination during filming. The director becomes the slain son of the professor. Meanwhile, Nagisa's agent reviews the film from the camera which consists of the film the professor took as he murdered his children and others at the hotel. As this film is played, Nagisa reenacts the events in her apparent hallucination. She discovers Yayoi in the cubby where the little girl was slain. Realizing that she is not the real reincarnation of Chisato, Nagisa witnesses the actors, including Yayoi and the director, and the two men seen before the opening credits, all transform into the people they portray in the places where they died. Yuka is revealed as a maid who was hung. With all the victims walking towards her, Nagisa escapes the hotel and runs down the road and into the town. Simultaneously, her agent sees the film of this escape from the professor. Ultimately, Nagisa finds herself cornered in a store. She grabs a piece of class to kill herself before the doll can come to her. She looks at her reflection in the glass and sees the face of the professor. At the same time, her agent watches the knife in the hand of the professor in his film reveal Nagisa's reflection before he cuts his own throat. Nagisa starts to reenact the professor's suicide but the doll reaches her and stops her in time to tell her that they will be together forever. 

A group of executives watch Nagisa's take. Among them is the professor's wife. Near the end of the take, Nagisa collapses shaking and screaming as crew members come to her aid. Notice by the professor's wife is her two children in the scene some distance away. She smiles with satisfaction. Sometime later, in a mental ward, Nagisa is bound in a full-body wrap and still haunted by the souls of Omori's children. The professor's wife looks at her from the window of her door then passes through the smaller aperture for food her children's favourite toys: a red ball and the doll. Nagisa screams as they are shoved into her solitary confinement cell as the professor's wife smile. Nagisa eventually calms down with a sinister smile on her face as the ghosts of the children close in on her.

{{nihongo|'''''Retribution'''''|叫|Sakebi}} is a 2006 Japanese [[mystery film]] directed by [[Kiyoshi Kurosawa]], starring [[Koji Yakusho]], of a detective's investigation of serial murders that leads him to a mysterious woman in red who slowly draws him into the darkness.

==Plot==
Yoshioka, an experienced [[detective]], investigates the [[murder]] of an unknown woman in a red dress. She was drowned on the Tokyo waterfront, but an autopsy reveals that her stomach is full of seawater. Moreover, all the clues he finds relate to himself: A button found at the murder scene matches one that is missing from his own coat, and fingerprints found match his own. Yoshioka realizes that the only viable suspect is himself; but he doesn't remember a thing. 

A [[ghost]] in a red dress soon starts appearing to him. As these apparitions become more intense and bizarre, similar murders occur with people killing loved ones for small infractions. All the perpetrators are found by Yoshioka as he searches for clues about the original murder. Eventually the drowned woman is identified. Yoshioka visits her parents, only to find she had a boyfriend who was extorting her parents, who happens to visit the house at the same time. He quickly confesses to the crime.

Yoshioka is visited by the ghost again who reveals that she is not the murdered woman, but a ghost of a woman whom he saw in the window of an [[psychiatric hospital|asylum]] fifteen years ago who has died. All of the murderers took the ferry past the same asylum. Yoshioka sends his girlfriend away, afraid of what he might do to her. He goes to the asylum, where the woman in red agrees to forgive him for not helping her 15 years ago.  He goes home, only to discover that he murdered his girlfriend 6 months ago. Going [[insane]], he tries to forget. He collects the bones, and goes to the asylum to pick up the ghost's bones. His partner arrives at his apartment and finds the empty bowl Yoshioka used to commit the murder. The ghost stalks him in the background. As an [[earthquake]] occurs, the bowl is now filled with water. The ghost suddenly appears above him and dives down dragging them both into the bowl. The film ends with Yoshioka walking in the street holding a bag containing his girlfriend's and the ghost's bones, with the ghost repeatedly saying: &quot;I am dead. So please, I want everyone to die too&quot;.

==Reception==
Adam DiLeo of [[IGN]] gave ''Retribution'' a mixed review, saying that the films is worth seeing despite it is not on par with [[Kiyoshi Kurosawa]]'s previous films such as ''[[Cure (film)|Cure]]'' and ''[[Bright Future]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/06/25/ny-asian-film-festival-07-retribution|title=NY Asian Film Festival 07: Retribution|publisher=[[IGN]]|first=Adam|last=DiLeo|date=June 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derek Elley of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised [[Koji Yakusho]]'s performance, saying he &quot;makes an ideal protagonist, one with whom the audience is never quite sure whether it can identify&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2006/film/reviews/retribution-3-1200512764/|title=Review: &quot;Retribution&quot;|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Derek|last=Elley|date=October 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the ghost of the film, is seeking revenge from past events of which every protagonist is apparently responsible, the horror in ''Retribution'' has been seen by some as expressing some kind of social illness and [[Collective responsibility|collective guilt]] in our contemporary world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinepinion.blogspot.com/2007/07/retribution.html|title=Retribution|publisher=Cinepinion|date=July 6, 2007|accessdate=April 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d-kaz.com/reviews/review.php?id=370|title=Retribution|publisher=d-kaz.com|date=February 21, 2007|accessdate=April 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{more plot|date=November 2016}}
TV show host Nami asks her viewers to send in home movies; she receives a [[snuff film]] apparently shot at a nearby factory. Taking a camera crew out to investigate, Nami finds the factory deserted. As Nami and her crew begin to scour the factory, they are murdered one-by-one in grisly fashion until only Nami remains. She ultimately discovers that the killer is Hideki, a small, fetus-like man [[Parasitic twin|conjoined]] to his fully grown, naive twin-brother, who seems unaware of the killings.

==Production==

&quot;'''Redrum'''&quot; is the sixth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 8)|eighth season]] of the American [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on {{nowrap|December 10, 2000}}. The story for the episode was developed by [[Steven Maeda]] and [[Daniel Arkin]], the teleplay was written by Maeda, and the episode was directed by [[Peter Markle]]. &quot;Redrum&quot; is a &quot;Monster-of-the-Week&quot; story, unconnected to the series' wider [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. The episode received a [[Nielsen rating]] of 8.1 and was viewed by 13.2 million households. Overall, the episode received moderately positive reviews from critics.

The series centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) and her new partner [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]])—following the alien abduction of her former partner, [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]])—who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. In this episode, a lawyer friend of Doggett's named Martin Wells tries to clear his name of the crime after his wife is murdered. Unfortunately for him, his perception of time regresses backwards, day by day. This leads to confusion, but ultimately an answer as to who killed Wells' wife.

&quot;Redrum&quot;, described as a &quot;Twilight Zone-type thriller&quot; by critics, heavily featured the actor [[Joe Morton]], who had previously played a role in the 1991 sci-fi film ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' alongside series co-star Robert Patrick. The title of the episode was purposely picked by episode writer Steven Maeda to be &quot;murder&quot; spelled backwards. The episode's main character, Martin Wells, was named after famed 19th century author [[H.G. Wells]].

==Plot==
Martin Wells, a renowned [[Baltimore]] prosecutor, wakes up in a prison cell and notices a stitched-up wound on his right cheek. A guard enters and takes him for his transfer. Wells' long-time friend, [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]), and his partner, [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]), await him and warn of reporters outside. As he exits the building, a man Wells recognizes draws a pistol and shoots him. Wells stares at Scully’s watch as he dies. The hands stop and then begin to turn backwards.

Upon waking up again, Wells is surprised to find no bullet wounds on his body. Scully and Doggett arrive to interrogate Wells, but he is confused about what is going on. A furious Doggett claims that he has been accused of murdering his wife, Vicky, and initially believes that Wells is faking his confusion in order to build an [[insanity defense]]. However, Doggett shows signs of doubt when he notices Wells' genuine anguish over Vicky's death. Wells is brought into court and he recognizes his [[father-in-law]], Al Cawdry, as the man who shot him. When Wells' next court date is announced to be Thursday, he realizes that he has somehow travelled back to the day before his shooting. When the judge decides to transfer Wells to a different cell, he makes a scene in the court and accuses Cawdry of planning to kill him during the transfer.

In his second meeting of the day with Scully and Doggett, Wells explains that he cannot remember the last few days. Scully suggests that maybe he did do it. Wells begins having flashes of the murder but they are unclear. Waiting in his cell, he kills a spider. Later, a [[nanny cam]] from his house reveals that the only person to arrive between the police’s arrival and the last time his wife is on camera is Martin Wells. Eventually, Wells meets his lawyers and tells them about the nanny cam. However, it turns out that it is Wednesday: Wells is somehow “living the week backwards”.

While going to meet Doggett and Scully, Wells gets shoved into a dominos game and while picking them up gets slashed on his right cheek from a man with the spider web tattoo on his hand. Wells tells Doggett and Scully that he is moving backwards in time and cannot recall the past few days. Doggett is skeptical, but Scully hears him out. Wells says there must be a reason for it and Scully suggests that the answer may already be within him. Studying the evidence of the case, Wells has a flash of the murder that reveals the knife in a hand with a spider web tattoo.

Martin next awakes in Doggett's home. Wells tells Doggett the description of the killer but the man isn’t in lock-up yet because that won’t happen until Wednesday. Doggett and Wells arrive at the apartment and retrieve the nanny cam, but discover that someone disabled the cam and used its remote control, a device no one knew about except Mr. and Mrs. Wells and their nanny, Trina Galvez. At Trina Galvez’s home, Wells and Doggett discover the killer, a man named Cesar Ocampo, who threatened to kill Galvez's family if she refused him entrance. At the station house, Doggett informs Wells that Ocampo only wants to talk to him. Ocampo reveals that his brother, Hector, was sentenced to time in prison for a false conviction. Wells bargains with Cesar Ocampo, saying that if Cesar confesses to Vicky’s murder, he will take a look at his brother’s case. Cesar tells him that Hector hung himself in a jail cell a few weeks ago. Doggett calls Martin Wells out into the hall and the police arrest Martin because they have a case against him. Evidence against Ocampo isn’t strong enough yet.

Martin wakes up, having moved back to the day before. He rushes home to try and save his wife. Martin admits to evidence suppression and that Hector Ocampo’s brother is out for revenge. Wells and his wife hide. Suddenly, they hear someone else at the door. Ocampo appears and accosts Wells. Vicky Wells comes out of hiding but is thrown through the coffee table. As Ocampo prepares to slit her throat, he is shot dead by timely arriving Doggett. Wells eventually goes to prison for his evidence suppression, a punishment he feels he deserves.&lt;ref name=cast/&gt;

==Production==
[[File:USA Los-Angeles Ambassador-Hotel.jpg|Wells' assassination scene was filmed at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in Los Angeles|200px|thumb|right]]
&quot;Redrum&quot;, described as a &quot;Twilight Zone-type thriller&quot; in ''The Complete X-Files'', was developed by [[Steven Maeda]] and [[Daniel Arkin]], while the teleplay was written solely by Maeda.&lt;ref name=&quot;huwritz&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=prodinfo/&gt; Maeda purposely picked the title to be the backwards spelling of &quot;murder&quot;; notably, the same plot device was used by novelist—[[Chinga (The X-Files)|and one-time ''X-Files'' writer]]—[[Stephen King]] in his book ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''.&lt;ref name=prodinfo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Pearson, and Dickson p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Maeda used the spider and its web to symbolize Martin Wells' confusion at being trapped in his situation.&lt;ref name=prodinfo/&gt; Wells was played by noted actor [[Joe Morton]] who had previously played a role in the 1991 sci-fi film ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''. [[Robert Patrick]] later noted that &quot;Joe Morton is a fantastic actor. We never worked together in [''Terminator 2''], but we're in that movie together. And Joe was ''[[The Brother from Another Planet]]''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;huwritz&quot;&gt;Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene of Martin Wells' assassination was filmed at the &quot;legendary&quot; [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in Los Angeles. This location, which has been the shooting location for over 200 productions, including ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' and ''[[Pretty Woman]]'', is perhaps more infamous as the site of Presidential candidate [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert F. Kennedy's assassination]] by [[Sirhan Sirhan]] in 1968. Several of the names in the episode were allusions to historical figures or acquaintances of the writer. Most notably, Martin Wells is named after famed 19th century author [[H.G. Wells]], noted for his contributions to science fiction with ''[[The Time Machine]]'' in 1896 and ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' in 1898. Furthermore, the character of Janet Wilson, the lawyer of Wells, was named after Maeda's wife.&lt;ref name=prodinfo&gt;{{cite web|title=The X-Files – &quot;Redrum&quot; – Research|url=http://www.thexfiles.com/episodes/season8/8x06_research.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011218203918/http://www.thexfiles.com/episodes/season8/8x06_research.html|archivedate=29 December 2001|publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]]|work=''TheXFiles.com''|date=10 December 2000|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical reception to the episode was moderately positive, although several reviewers criticized the episode's monologues. [[Television Without Pity]] writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode a &quot;B+&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TWP&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/the-xfiles/redrum.php?page=13 |title=Redrum |work=[[Television Without Pity]] |publisher=[[NBCUniversal]] |first=Jessica |last=Morgan |date=10 December 2000 |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan criticized the episode's narrative, sardonically noting that Martin Wells was a &quot;man who may get a second chance. At life. At truth.

The two noted that the episode was &quot;constructed with great skill by Steven Maeda and Daniel Arkin.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;shear&quot;/&gt; Despite this, Shearman and Pearson noted that &quot;with the series in flux, this is an especially unhelpful time to attempt an episode which so abandons the house style; ''The X-Files'' urgently needs to assert what it is, not what it isn't.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;shear&quot;&gt;Shearman and Pearson, p. 233–234&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Tomie'''''|富江}} is a 1998 Japanese horror film directed by [[Ataru Oikawa]].{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=276}} It is the first film in the [[Tomie (film series)|''Tomie'' film series]], based on a [[manga]] [[Tomie|of the same name]] by [[Junji Ito]].

==Plot==
The film opens with the police investigating the murder of high school girl [[Tomie Kawakami]] ([[Miho Kanno]]). They learn that in the months following the crime, nine students and one teacher have either committed suicide or gone insane. The detective assigned to the case learns that three years prior another Tomie Kawakami was murdered in rural Gifu prefecture. Other slain Tomie Kawakami's are discovered stretching all the way back to the 1860s, right when Japan began to modernize. The detective tracks down one of Tomie's classmates called Tsukiko ([[Mami Nakamura]]), an art student who is being treated for amnesia. She has absolutely no memory of the three-month period around Tomie's death, and is starting to suspect the cause has a supernatural source. Meanwhile, Tsukiko's neighbor is rearing a peculiar baby-like creature. Over the span of a couple weeks, it grows into a beautiful teenaged girl with orange eyes responding to the name of Tomie Kawakami.

Soon afterwards, Tomie begins seducing Tsukiko's boyfriend Yuuichi (Kouta Kusano). Meanwhile, Tsukiko enters her new neighbor's apartment to investigate. Upon discovering her friend's dead body, she is attacked by her landlord and passes out due to asphyxiation. She wakes up in her psychiatrist's office and encounters Tomie. Tomie starts emotionally taunting Tsukiko and tries feeding her live cockroaches. She then begins taking selfies next to her. Soon thereafter, Tsukiko's boyfriend murders Tomie. As they go bury Tomie's headless body in the woods, she comes back to life and Tsukiko runs off further into the woods and finds herself on a boat dock. Tomie then appears once again, now fully regenerated, and kisses Tsukiko on the lips. They both begin laughing as Tsukiko lights a flare and sets Tomie on fire.

Tsukiko is now shown leading a normal life, still taking photographs and being interested in art. One day as she goes to develop a picture she took of herself, she notices a mole under her left eye she didn't have before; the same kind of mole Tomie had. Tsukiko then looks at herself in the mirror in shock as Tomie appears, smiling.

==Production==
[[File:27th Tokyo International Film Festival Miho Kanno.jpg|thumb|[[Miho Kanno]] was chosen specifically by manga author [[Junji Ito]] for the role.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=71}}]]
Director [[Ataru Oikawa]] admired the original manga for ''[[Tomie (manga)|Tomie]]'', referring to it as a &quot;fairy tale in bad taste&quot;.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=71}} Opposed to a shocking and gorey film, Oikawa desired to make a film he described as not one &quot;where people scream with fear. I didn't imagine that kind of horror movie. I wanted this to be more like a drama for youth.&quot;{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=71}} As the comic contained graphic violence, Oikawa decided that he would work from a clean slate while still seeking seek manga author [[Junji Ito]]'s approval and input.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=72}} The film that was written by Oikawa, borrows character and situations from the stories &quot;Photograph&quot; and Kiss&quot;, from Ito's original manga, while seemingly ignoring most of what happens in the story &quot;Mansion&quot; which also features Tsukiko as the protagonist.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=72}} The film acts like a sequel to the manga taking place several years after the original story.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=72}}

For the role of Tomie, [[Miho Kanno]] was chosen specifically by manga author Junji Ito for the role.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=71}} The film's score was composed by Hiroshi Futami and Toshihiro Kimura while the film contains a theme song from Japanese pop act [[World Famous]].{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=74}}

==Release==
''Tomie'' was released in Japan on October 6, 1998.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=276}}

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=November 2014}}
''[[Video Watchdog]]'' reviewed ''Tomie'', stating that it was &quot;too mild and slow-going though it is attractively photographed and Ms. Kanno, with her soulless eyes and utterly creepy smile, remains the quintessential Tomie.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Cooke|first=Bill|magazine=[[Video Watchdog]]|issue=115|page=9|ISSN=1070-9991|title=Tomie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and influence==
After the release of ''Tomie'', the first sequel was not a theatrical film but a direct-to-video release of ''[[Tomie: Another Face]]'' released on October 25, 1999.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=78}}{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=278}} The next theatrical ''Tomie'' film was ''[[Tomie: Replay]]'' that was released on the bottom half of a double bill with ''[[Uzumaki (film)|Uzumaki]]'' on February 11, 2000.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=79}}{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=280}} In 2005, the film ''[[Tomie: Beginning]]'' was released as a prequel adapted faithfully from the original manga.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=85}}{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=298}} ''Tomie: Beginning'' ends where ''Tomie'' begins.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=85}}

== Plot ==

While making popcorn, Kenny is called by an unknown person, who flirts with him. The conversation turns disturbing, and ends when a man wearing a hood and face paint breaks into Kenny's house, and rapes him. The next day, Kenny's friends discuss what happened to him, revealing that he was so traumatized from being sexually assaulted that he has suffered a mental breakdown. Investigating the attack is Deputy Derek, who questions Kenny's friends, all of whom have reasonable alibis. Derek then has sex with Ricky, and afterward Ricky mentions that Kenny had recently dumped Stuart.

After Derek leaves, dismissing a nosy reporter on his way out, Sam chats with Tom, and brings up Chris, his boyfriend who had been raped and murdered almost a year ago, supposedly by a man named Steve Warner. Sam goes home, and after masturbating he is taunted over the phone by Kenny's rapist, who then attacks him. Sam fights off his assailant, and accuses Brian of being him, as he showed up right after the attack, cellular phone in hand. Brian is arrested by Derek, but is released the next day, due to a lack of evidence, and Sam getting another call from the rapist.

Despite all that has happened, everyone attends a party being held at Stuart's house. Tom goes to get beer and light bulbs out of the garage, where he is confronted by and has sex with the rapist, who drowns him in a [[hot tub]] afterward. Ricky goes to look for Tom, and is locked in the garage by the rapist, revealed to be Brian, who is working with Stuart. Brian murdered Chris and framed his boyfriend Steve for it because Chris and Steve were having an affair, and now he and Stuart are going to kill Sam, after forcing him to participate in a threesome, as &quot;no porno is complete without a good threeway&quot;. When the trio ejaculates, Derek and the reporter enter, and arrest Brian and Stuart, the reporter having recorded the two bragging about their crimes from outside.

* Tommy Lord as Kenny Beeker

== Reception ==

Jeremy Spencer of ''[[AVN (magazine)|GayVN]]'' gave ''Moan'' a 3½ out of 5, criticizing the editing and direction, but still calling it &quot;a fast-paced sexual romp that is both hysterical and creepy&quot; with a cast composed of &quot;powerhouse sexual performers and some decent actors&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://gay.avn.com/movies/26496.html|title = ''Moan''|last = Spencer|first = Jeremy|publisher = ''GayVN''|date = 1 November 1999|website = gay.avn.com|accessdate = 26 September 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt; A score of 3/4 was given to the film by the Gay Erotic Video Index, which wrote, &quot;It's a funny, [[Camp (style)|campy]] spoof that is loaded with hot sex, over-the-top performances and a spattering of technical [[Military slang#SNAFU|snafus]]&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Index&quot;&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.gayeroticvideoindex.com/V/1/13701.html|title = ''Moan'' 1|last = |first = |publisher = Gay Erotic Video Index|date = |website = gayeroticvideoindex.com|accessdate = 26 September 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt; The film won Best Sex Comedy at the 2000 [[GayVN Awards]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Index&quot;/&gt;

Both the novel and the manga have been licensed in North America by [[Yen Press]].

==Plot==
In 1972, Misaki, a popular student of Yomiyama North Middle School's class 3-3, suddenly died partway through the school year. Devastated by the loss, the students and teacher behaved like Misaki was still alive, leading to a strange presence on the graduation photo. In Spring 1998, Kōichi Sakakibara transfers into Yomiyama's class 3-3, where he meets Mei Misaki, a quiet student whom their classmates and teacher seemingly ignore. The class is soon caught up in a strange phenomenon, in which students and their relatives begin to die in often gruesome ways. Realizing that these deaths are related to the &quot;Misaki of 1972&quot;, a yearly calamity that has struck most every class 3-3 since 1972, Kōichi and Mei seek to figure out how to stop it before it kills anymore of their classmates or them.

{{nihongo|'''''The Stories of Ibis'''''|アイの物語|Ai no Monogatari}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] science-fiction [[light novel]] by {{nihongo|'''Hiroshi Yamamoto'''|山本 弘}} and translated by Takami Nieda. Yamamoto considered this to be an easier read than his earlier science fiction novel 'God Never Keeps Silent' because of its &quot;light novel touch&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yamamoto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haikasoru.com/the-stories-of-ibis/hiroshi-yamamoto-on-the-stories-of-ibis/|title=Hiroshi Yamamoto on THE STORIES OF IBIS|work=haikasoru.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The light novel was published in Japanese by [[Kadokawa Shoten]] and in English by [[Viz Media]] under their 'Haikasoru' imprint.

The Stories of Ibis is told through a collection of short stories. All but two had been previously published. The two that Yamamoto wrote for the novel were 'The Day Shion Came' and 'AI's Story'. This is similar to [[The Illustrated Man]] by [[Ray Bradbury]]. Yamamoto drew from Bradbury's idea of short stories that were loosely connected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yamamoto&quot;/&gt; He represented this influence in the novel by giving Ibis a facial tattoo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yamamoto&quot;/&gt;

==Plot==
The Stories of Ibis begins with a wandering storyteller who encounters Ibis. He has the mindset that all robots are a threat to humanity and must be fought against for survival. He attacks the robot Ibis, not aware of who she is, as a result of his mindset. Ibis tells the storyteller that she is far more proficient in battle. During the battle the storyteller becomes injured and Ibis takes him to an android hospital to care for him. While he is recovering Ibis offers to tell him stories. While originally skeptical he agrees after Ibis makes it clear that the stories are not taboo. The space after each story is referred to as intermission and is a time for Ibis to comment on the story she just told.

===The Universe on my Hands===
The story is about a group of friends who are writing a science fiction story over the internet. One of the group members kills someone in real life. The rest of the short story is about how the group fights to convince this man to not commit suicide, but to turn himself in. He resolves to turn himself in, being hopeful to the future because he knows he has friends who care about him. The ending words of the story are a commentary. While the story they were writing was not real, the emotions they were feeling were real.

===A Romance in Virtual Space===
This is another story about human interactions over the internet. The device that allows people to enter virtual reality (VR) is MUGEN Net. Such devices are extremely expensive and most people need to go to a public server to use one. However the girl's parents in this story are wealthy enough to own one. This girl is shopping in VR when a boy meets her and asks her out for ice cream. All goes well and they plan for another. After some time of VR dating and awesome adventures with a female heroine, they agree to meet up in real life. He discovers that in reality, she is blind, yet he thinks she is brave and they continue dating. It's a wonderful short story of a secret utopia inside a dystopian culture of technology.

===Mirror Girl===
A short story about an artificial intelligence that grows over time with human interaction. The inspiration for this story was Ray Bradbury's [[I Sing the Body Electric (Bradbury)|I Sing the Body Electric]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Yamamoto&quot;/&gt; The mirror girl Shalice starts off with basic knowledge and by interacting with her owner develops. The owner grows up and marries a technician who incubates Shalice by teaching her in the virtual world at many thousand times faster than average life. When he is done, Strong Eye is created. Strong Eye is the fully developed and completely intelligent AI.

===Black Hole Diver===
A futuristic story about an artificial space station and people who go diving into a black hole. The space station cannot stop people but is sorry that they go to their deaths because none of them get past the event horizon. Then one girl comes who has the space ship, the training, and the research necessary to attempt to dive into the black hole. As she goes into the black hole the space station can no longer observe. She may have made it, she could have been destroyed.

===A World Where Justice is Just===
An anime flavored story about the intelligence of people being scanned onto a computer network. The AIs in the network fight crime and live repeating lives. At the end of each year they start anew, but different story lines. Thousands of 'extras' populate the network and are the ones subject to harm and deletion. The protagonist has a pen pal in real life who explains to her that the real world is under attack and that there are no respawns and no extras. The AI finds this so cruel that people would willingly kill each other when they can't come back.

===The Day Shion Came===
The stories leading up to this were all relatively short. This and the next took up over 100 pages each. This is a story about an android named Shion who works in a Japanese nursing facility. Shion comes with only extensive nursing training but lacks the knowledge of how to communicate with the residents. After months of training she informs her adviser that she believes all humans have dementia, which explains their irrational behavior. Near the end of the story one of the residents threatens suicide but Shion convinces him to step down and be rational.

===AI's Story===
The culminating story of the entire novel. It is about Ibis herself. She starts off as a virtual reality fighting program and overtime develops intelligence. Her master gains enough funds to create her a body in the real world or level 0. There is significant hate against TAIs (True Artificial Intelligence) in the real world. Ibis and her friend Raven rebel against their masters to make a point. Human hatred was destroying them. After many years robots took prevalence and most humans realized they were not worthy to be the guardians of Earth and died in peace. The remaining population was stubborn and fought against the robots for centuries. The storyteller is a child of this generation, being raised in hatred and ignorance. The robots sought to take him captive, and teach him the truth so that he could go to the villages where people lived and teach them the truth. The whole point was they cared for the humans and wanted them to live in peace, rather than fighting for their survival.

==Reception==
It was reviewed by the [[Denver Post]] to be an &quot;excellent novel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_15129125?source=rss|title=Science Fiction Books|work=denverpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a Japanese translated to English novel it has a small audience. The novel was given a 3.85 of 5 by the reviewers at Librarything.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.librarything.com/work/9772306|title=The Stories of Ibis|work=LibraryThing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewers of Google Books gave it a 4.33 of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mlMgQAAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+stories+of+ibis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NMnRTqSyEKXXiQLq9NzCCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA|title=The Stories of Ibis (Novel)|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''This Grave Is Too Small for Me''''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: '''''Mali mi je ovaj grob''''', alternatively given translations such as '''''This Tomb Is Too Small''''') is a [[Theatre#Drama|dramatic stage production]], written by [[Serbia]]n playwright [[Biljana Srbljanović]], that focuses on assassin [[Gavrilo Princip]] and his associates in the weeks leading up to [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Princip's murder]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in 1914. The assassination played a major role in world events and moved things towards the breakout of [[World War I]]. As a [[Historical fiction|historically-based work]] adapting the controversial period, moral conflicts and other character-driven issues are explored although many details have been changed.&lt;ref name=info/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;&lt;ref name=play&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.sarajevotimes.com/play-mali-mi-je-ovaj-grob/|title=Play: ''Mali mi je ovaj grob''|accessdate=September 8, 2015|date=May 2, 2014|publisher=''[[Sarajevo Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Play (theatre)|stage play]] made its debut at the [[Schauspielhaus Wien|Schauspielhaus]] in Vienna in October 2013. It has received favorable reactions from crowds in a variety of different cities in which it has been performed, including Berlin and Belgrade.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{citenews|title=Biljana Srbljanovic on Her New Play|publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]]''|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303627504579559673459534630|accessdate=September 7, 2015|date=May 22, 2014|first=Ginanne|last=Brownell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Srbljanović has remarked that she feels &quot;not very much into history and utterly not interested in World War I&quot; yet found Princip's story fascinating given the figure's challenging ethical and philosophical ideas.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; In October 2014, the play won two awards during the International Theatre Festival of Small and Experimental Stage (MESS) ceremony; one award went to Srbljanović herself and another went to Sarajevo-based actor [[Ermin Bravo]], for best stage performance.&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{citenews|title='This Grave Is Too Small for Me' wins two awards in Sarajevo|url=http://www.infobalkans.com/2014/10/13/grave-too-small-me-wins-two-awards-sarajevo|publisher=[http://www.infobalkans.com infobalkans.com]|accessdate=September 7, 2015|date=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Life Is Strange''''' is an [[Episodic video game|episodic]] [[graphic adventure]] video game developed by [[Dontnod Entertainment]] and published by [[Square Enix]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[Xbox One]]. The game was released in five episodic parts periodically throughout 2015. The game's plot focuses on Max Caulfield, an 18-year-old photography student who discovers that she has the ability to [[Time travel|rewind time]] at any moment, leading her every choice to enact the [[butterfly effect]]. After having foreseen an approaching storm, Max must take on the responsibility to prevent it from destroying her town. The player's actions will adjust the narrative as it unfolds, and reshape it once allowed to travel back in time. [[Quest (video gaming)#Gather quests|Fetch quests]] and making environmental changes represent the forms of [[Puzzle video game|puzzle solving]] in addition to using [[Dialog tree|branching choices]] for conversation.

Development of ''Life Is Strange'' began in April 2013. It was formed with an episodic format in mind, for reasons both financial and creative. The developers conducted field research on the setting by travelling to the [[Pacific Northwest]], and subverted known [[archetype]]s to make the characters. Player feedback influenced the adjustments made to the episodes. Story and [[character arc]] serve as the central point in the game. During its release, ''Life Is Strange'' received generally favourable reviews commending the character development, rewind game mechanic and tackling of [[taboo]] subjects. It won the [[British Academy Games Awards|BAFTA Games Award]] for Best Story, the [[Peabody Award|Peabody]]-[[Facebook]] Futures of Media Award and [[The Game Awards]]' Games for Impact Award. Common criticisms included the [[slang]] that was used, poor [[Lip sync|lip-syncing]] in earlier episodes, and [[Tone (literature)|tonal]] inconsistencies in the story. It has sold over three million copies as of May 2017. A prequel, ''[[Life Is Strange: Before the Storm|Before the Storm]]'', was released in 2017, while a sequel, ''[[Life Is Strange 2]]'', is in development.

==Plot==
''Life Is Strange'' is set in the fictional town of Arcadia Bay, [[Oregon]], and is told from the perspective of Maxine &quot;Max&quot; Caulfield (Hannah Telle), a twelfth grade student attending Blackwell Academy during October 2013. During photography class with her teacher Mark Jefferson (Derek Phillips), Max experiences a vision of a lighthouse being destroyed by a swelling [[tornado]]. Leaving for the restroom to regain her composure, she witnesses classmate Nathan Prescott (Nik Shriner) accidentally kill a woman in a fit of rage. In a single, sudden effort, she develops the ability to [[Time travel|rewind time]] and rescues the girl; revealed to be her childhood friend Chloe Price ([[Ashly Burch]]). The two reunite and go for a walk at the lighthouse, where Max reveals to Chloe her capacity to travel back in time. It is established that the vision is rather the reckoning of a future event: a storm approaching the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=30 January 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Chrysalis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Max observes fellow student Kate Marsh (Dayeanne Hutton) being bullied for a [[viral video]] depicting her kissing several students at a party. It is implied that she was [[Drug facilitated sexual assault|drugged]], and Max suspects Nathan as the perpetrator.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrysal15&quot;&gt;{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=24 March 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Out of Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meeting Chloe at the diner where her mother Joyce (Cissy Jones) works, they decide to experiment with Max's power at Chloe's secret scrapyard hideout. However, strain causes Max to have a nosebleed and faint. Chloe takes her back to Blackwell, but class is halted when everyone is called out to the courtyard. Kate commits suicide by jumping off the roof of the girls' dorm. Max manages to rewind and time stops unexpectedly as she reaches Kate, giving Max the opportunity to convince her to come down. Max ultimately resolves to uncover what happened to Kate and Chloe's missing friend Rachel Amber.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrysal15&quot; /&gt; Max and Chloe break into the principal's office that night to investigate and enter the pool for a swim before evading David Madsen (Don McManus), head of security at Blackwell and Chloe's stepfather, and fleeing back to Chloe's place. The next morning, they sneak into the [[motorhome]] of Frank Bowers (Daniel Bonjour), drug dealer and friend of Rachel, and learn that Rachel was in a relationship with Frank and lied to Chloe about it, causing Chloe to storm off feeling betrayed. Max returns to her dormitory and examines a childhood photo of her and Chloe, but is suddenly transported to the day the picture was taken. Max prevents Chloe's father William ([[Joe Ochman]]) from dying in a traffic collision, which inadvertently creates an [[Multiverse|alternative reality]] where William is alive but Chloe has been [[Paralysis|paralysed from the neck down]] as a result of a collision in her own car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=19 May 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Chaos Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Max uses the photo to undo her decision and return to the present day, restoring Chloe's health. Continuing their investigation, Max and Chloe obtain clues leading them to an abandoned barn owned by the influential Prescott family. They discover a hidden bunker containing pictures of Kate and Rachel tied up and intoxicated, with Rachel being buried at Chloe's secret hideout. They hurry back to the scrapyard and find Rachel's grave, much to Chloe's despair. Max follows Chloe at the school party to confront Nathan, believing he will target fellow student Victoria Chase (Dani Knights). They receive a text from Nathan threatening to destroy the evidence, returning them to the scrapyard. All of a sudden, the two are ambushed by Jefferson, who [[Anesthesia|anaesthetises]] Max and kills Chloe with a shot to the head. Max is kidnapped and held captive in the &quot;[[Darkroom|Dark Room]]&quot;, a place Jefferson has been drugging and photographing young girls to capture their innocence. Max escapes into a photograph and emerges back at the beginning in Jefferson's class. She alerts David, getting Jefferson arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=28 July 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Dark Room}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Max is given the opportunity to go to [[San Francisco]] and have one of her photos displayed in an art gallery. She calls Chloe from the event, realizing that, for all her effort, the storm has reached Arcadia Bay. Max travels back to the time at which she took the gallery photo, which eventually leads her to sojourn alternative realities as they devolve into a [[dream]]scape nightmare. Max and Chloe finally return to the lighthouse and confront the fact that Max brought the storm into existence by saving Chloe from being shot by Nathan earlier in the week. The only way to prevent it is for Max to go back to that moment via a photo she took and allow Chloe to be killed by Nathan. Max must make a choice: sacrifice Chloe's life to save Arcadia Bay, or sacrifice Arcadia Bay to spare Chloe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Life Is Strange&quot;&gt;{{cite video game|title=Life Is Strange|developer=Dontnod Entertainment|publisher=Square Enix|date=20 October 2015|platform=Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360|level=Polarized}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Life Is Strange'' achieved financial and commercial success, Dontnod Entertainment started to become more prominent in the video game industry; publishers pursued the studio for the first time, whereas they previously had to pursue publishers themselves. CEO Oskar Guilbert said that the game saved his company financially after the mediocre sales of ''[[Remember Me (video game)|Remember Me]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;solicited success&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/how-life-is-strange-changed-dontnod/0174354 |title=How Life is Strange changed Dontnod |first=Christopher |last=Dring |date=25 October 2016 |website=[[The Market for Computer &amp; Video Games|MCV]] |accessdate=25 October 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026080029/http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/how-life-is-strange-changed-dontnod/0174354 |archivedate=26 October 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, [[Legendary Entertainment|Legendary Digital Studios]] and Square Enix, in conjunction with dj2 Entertainment announced that they would be adapting ''Life Is Strange'' as a digital series.&lt;ref name=&quot;adaptation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/legendary-tackling-adaptation-life-is-914899 |title=Legendary Tackling Adaptation of 'Life Is Strange' Video Game (Exclusive) |first=Borys |last=Kit |date=27 July 2016 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=27 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728134633/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/legendary-tackling-adaptation-life-is-914899 |archivedate=28 July 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Legendary said that, at the time of the announcement, they were meeting with potential writers for the series adaptation, which would be set in Arcadia Bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;writers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legendary.com/legendary-digital-studios-partners-with-square-enix-and-dj2-to-adapt-award-winning-episodic-videogame-life-is-strange-into-digital-series/|title=Legendary Digital Studios Partners with Square Enix and dj2 to Adapt Award Winning Episodic Videogame Life Is Strange into Digital Series|date=27 July 2016|publisher=''[[Legendary Entertainment]]''|accessdate=30 July 2016|archivedate=1 June 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170601063430/https://www.legendary.com/legendary-digital-studios-partners-with-square-enix-and-dj2-to-adapt-award-winning-episodic-videogame-life-is-strange-into-digital-series/|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''KGB''''' is a [[video game]] released for the [[Commodore Amiga]] and [[IBM PC Compatible]] computers in 1992. Set in the decadent final days of the [[Soviet Union]], ''KGB'' is considered to be quite difficult, even for experienced gamers, since it relies on a real time clock and correct/wrong answers which can end the game immediately or after an event needed to be triggered; also, players may make errors which they will notice only hours later in-game. The game engine, graphics and interface have plenty of similarities with Cryo's [[Dune (video game)|''Dune'']].

''KGB'' was also released on CD under the title '''''Conspiracy''''', which included clips of Rukov's father played by [[Donald Sutherland]] giving advice. In the CD version, all references to &quot;KGB&quot; within the game and manual were changed to &quot;Conspiracy&quot;.

== Plot ==
The game is set in the summer of 1991.{{r|matthews199302}} The protagonist, Captain Maksim Mikahilovich Rukov, recently transferred to the Department P from the [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] after three years' duty, is ordered to investigate possible corruption inside the [[KGB]] after a former agent turned private eye was found murdered. However, as the plot progresses, Rukov finds himself investigating a political plot of dangerous proportions.

== Main characters ==
'''Captain Maksim Mikhailovich Rukov''' was born on 12 January 1966 in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]].  His parents, Mikhail Stepanovich Rukov and Svetlava Shailova, were killed on 23 May 1983 during an [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[terrorism|terrorist]] attack in [[Dushanbe]] (in the [[Tajik SSR]]) where his father was on active duty.  Rukov learned [[English language|English]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and joined the [[Spetsnaz]] as a [[paratrooper]] in 1988. The game begins as he makes his first steps in Department P.

'''Uncle Vanya''' is the brother of Rukov's father. He was also injured in the attack and uses a wheelchair, but is still able to take care of his nephew. He seems very suspicious of Maks's new employers.  (The name &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; is a nod to [[Uncle Vanya|the play of the same name]] by [[Anton Chekhov]] {{Citation needed|date=October 2014}})

'''Major Vovlov''' is Rukov's direct superior at Department P. He is bad-tempered and authoritarian.

'''Colonel Viktor Galushkin''' works at Department P. He personally knew Rukov's father and went after his assassins.

'''Major Radomir Savinkov''', also a Department P member, is Rukov's controller in Leningrad. He is highly intelligent.

'''Colonel Vladimir Kusnetsov''' is the head of KGB's Department 7 in Leningrad. He is very hostile to Department P.

'''Captain Piotr Chapkin''' works at Department 7 with his father-in-law, Colonel Kusnetsov.

'''Major Grigori Agabekov''' is second in command at Department 7. He served in Afghanistan. He has a clean record and good reputation.

'''Nathaniel Greenberg''' and '''Carla Wallace''' are American CIA agents who happen to be working on the same case as Rukov.

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' said in February 1993 that ''KGB'' &quot;was very much in the [[John Le Carre]] mold, with lots of hidden intrigue, deep subterfuge and criss-crossing plot lines. One almost expects [[George Smiley]] to turn up&quot;. The magazine praised the game's graphics and &quot;unusual feel&quot;, and concluded that it was &quot;an engrossing and atmospheric product with more depth and attention to detail than offered by most of the latest graphic adventures&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;matthews199302&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=103 |title=Virgin's New Graphic Adventure, KGB |work=Computer Gaming World |date=February 1993 |accessdate=6 July 2014 |author=Matthews, Robin |pages=88 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702235734/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=103 |archivedate=2 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1994 the magazine said of the CD [[video game remake|remake]], ''Conspiracy'', that although Donald Sutherland's acting was &quot;first-rate&quot; the addition of his scenes to the original game was &quot;a bit strained&quot;, concluding that &quot;The novelty of seeing a Big Screen actor in an adventure game is about the only thing going for it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cgw199404&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine

Some improvements have also been implemented in the PC version, such as upgrading the frame rate to 60 fps, shortening load times, and fixing bugs that were present in the original version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jenkins |first=David |date=12 May 2015 |url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/05/12/d4-on-pc-interview-swery-talks-pc-gaming-and-deadly-premonition-5192650/ |title=D4 on PC interview – SWERY talks PC gaming and Deadly Premonition |publisher=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Titanic: Adventure Out of Time''''' is a [[graphic adventure game#point-and-click adventure|point-and-click]] [[adventure game]] developed by [[CyberFlix]] and published in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] by [[GTE|GTE Entertainment]] and [[Europress]]  respectively, for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Macintosh]], in 1996. It takes place in a virtual representation of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. The player assumes the role of a former British spy who, during the [[The Blitz|London Blitz]], is sent back in time to the ''Titanic'' and must complete a previously failed mission to prevent [[World War I]], the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], and [[World War II]]. The gameplay involves exploring the ship and solving puzzles. There are multiple outcomes and endings to the game depending on the player's interaction with characters and use of items.

The game was created with CyberFlix's proprietary engine DreamFactory, which was also used to create ''[[Dust: A Tale of the Wired West]]''. Extensive research was done by the development team to ensure historical accuracy and to precisely recreate the ship's interior and exterior 3D environments. As with ''Dust'', ''Titanic'''s character animation was done by overlaying multiple still photos of actors to create mouth and facial movements. ''Titanic'' was commercially successful and received generally positive reviews from gaming critics, who praised the game's story, atmosphere and recreation of the ship, but criticized the character animation and some of the puzzles.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Titanic AOOT screenshot.png|thumb|250px|Screenshot showing the game's HUD and the [[Grand Staircase of the RMS Titanic|Grand Staircase]] of the ''Titanic''|left]]
''Titanic: Adventure Out of Time'' is an [[adventure game]] played from a [[First person (video games)|first-person perspective]] with a [[point-and-click]] interface in which players roam a fully rendered model of the RMS ''Titanic''. The game's control scheme is composed of a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]], whose arrow keys control the player's movements, and a [[Computer mouse|mouse]], with which the player can interact with objects, characters, select dialogue and options from the [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]] interface;&lt;ref name=GameSpot&gt;{{cite web|last1=McDonald|first1=Tim|date=15 November 1996|title=Titanic: Adventure out of Time Review - GameSpot|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/titanic-adventure-out-of-time-review/1900-2535016/|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are a [[Personal flotation device|lifesaver]] (which brings the player to the options menu), an inventory bag and a [[pocket watch]] that indicates the game's progression.

The puzzles in ''Titanic'' rely on collecting and using certain items to advance the story. Dialogue is also a significant aspect of the game. Characters are programmed to remember the player's actions and react accordingly, and thus the choice of dialogue options deeply influences the story's outcome as to what items the player can acquire or the tasks she or he is able to complete. As a result, the game can have a total of eight distinct endings, not all of which present success in the mission.{{sfn|Douglas|2001|p=12-13}}

Time is another important aspect of the game. The story does not occur in [[real time (media)|real time]], with time progressing only if certain tasks and puzzles are completed, as indicated by the aforementioned pocket watch; however, as soon as the player reaches the point in which the ''Titanic'' starts sinking, the game progresses in real time, and the player is thus given a time limit to complete the game. As mentioned above, there are multiple endings for the game's completion, some of which result in death.&lt;ref name=AGReview /&gt;&lt;ref name=JA /&gt;

In addition to the main story, the game also includes a &quot;ship's tour&quot; game mode which features characters in the game narrating certain aspects of the ship, its crew and passengers, and the sinking. These characters can be found in different locations in the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hudak|first1=Chris|date=1 March 2004|title=Titanic: Adventure out of Time Preview|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/titanic-adventure-out-of-time-preview/1100-2559946/|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the character narrations were already included with the game, while others could be downloaded from CyberFlix's official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rothstein|first1=Edward|title=Are the high-technology wonders of today any less sinkable than the Titanic?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/23/business/are-the-high-technology-wonders-of-today-any-less-sinkable-than-the-titanic.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=1 March 2016|date=23 June 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WVReview&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Grace|title=Timeless Titanic Sails A Digital Atlantic|url=http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/gamezone/html/reviews/titan.htm|publisher=WorldVillage|accessdate=16 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970709101634/http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/gamezone/html/reviews/titan.htm|archivedate=9 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Players assume the role of Frank Carlson, a former British secret agent who failed a mission aboard the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]; he now lives in an apartment. On 14 April 1942, Carlson is caught in an air raid during the [[The Blitz|London Blitz]] and his apartment is bombed. Carlson blacks out, before awakening in a ship quarters, as his younger self. He is informed that he is aboard the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]; Carlson discovers that he has somehow been summoned [[Time travel|back in time]] to the ship on the night it [[Sinking of the R.M.S. Titanic|sank]]. His memory from the original timeline intact, Carlson uses his knowledge of the future to have a second chance to complete his mission.

Carlson's first mission is to locate and retrieve a stolen copy of [[Omar Khayyam]]'s ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rubáiyát]]'', suspected of being in the possession of German [[Oberst|Colonel]] Zeitel, who is traveling to New York to inspect embassies in the United States and [[Central America]], alongside his young [[protegé]] Willi Von Haderlitz. It is revealed that the Colonel has made a deal with art dealer Sasha Barbicon to exchange the ''Rubáiyát'' for a painting in which there are hidden war plans stolen from the British government. They both act through a go-between, the [[History of Serbia#Principality/Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]n stowaway Vlad Demonic. In addition to the ''Rubáiyát'' and the painting, the player discovers that Willi is a spy for the [[Russian Empire|Russian]]s and has a notebook with names of top [[Bolshevik]] leaders. The notebook must be handed over to the [[Okhrana|Ochrana]] so that [[Communism|Communist]] rebels will be executed, preventing a threat to [[Nicholas II of Russia|the Czar]]. Barbicon is also in possession of a stolen diamond necklace intended to finance the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]], a Serbian military group. Assisting the player is fellow agent Penny Pringle.

[[File:Adolf Hitler Der Alte Hof.jpg|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]]'s  ''The Courtyard of the Old Residency in Munich'' appears as a key plot element]]
The player can also become involved in optional subplots that do not pertain to the central mission or the winning conditions of the game. One subplot involves retrieving a business document stolen by [[steel magnate]] Andrew Conkling's maid Shailagh Hacker. Other plots involve helping passengers such as the Lambeths, a wealthy couple whose marriage has deteriorated; Leyland Trask, a [[psychic]] from Boston; Reverend Edgar Troutt, a Protestant [[preacher]] from [[New Hampshire]] who is returning from a mission in [[Nyasaland]]; and Max Seidelmann, a businessman from Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Titanic: Adventure Out of Time |developer=[[CyberFlix]] |date=1996 |publisher=[[GTE Entertainment]] |platform=[[Microsoft Windows]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of objects the player obtains before escaping the ship affects the ending and how history plays out. If the player manages to successfully obtain all four objects, history is altered with [[World War I]], the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], and [[World War II]] never occurring.

* Without Vlad providing the necklace or the ''Rubáiyát'', the Black Hand is not financed and their plan to assassinate [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] backfires, preventing World War I.
* If the painting is obtained, it becomes a popular piece because of it surviving the sinking. The painting is revealed to be [[Adolf Hitler]]'s &quot;[[The Courtyard of the Old Residency in Munich]]&quot;, which causes him to become a famous artist after the painting is retrieved, preventing him from joining the National Socialists in Germany, averting the rise of the Nazis and World War II.
* If Willie's notebook survives, it's delivered to the Czar, the Bolshevik leaders (Stalin, Lenin, and Trotsky) are executed, and the Russian Revolution never occurs.

Afterwards, the character retires after a successful career to a world of peace. Depending on which items the player fails to collect, history will change, but certain wars or revolutions will still occur.{{sfn|Douglas|2001|p=13}}

We bathed in them. |source=—[[Andrew Nelson (author)|Andrew Nelson]] on the creation of ''Titanic''&lt;ref name=Gamasutra /&gt;}}

=== Conception ===
The concept for the game was created by writer and producer [[Andrew Nelson (author)|Andrew Nelson]], who spent ten months working on the game's script, changing the plot and characters in accordance to the needs and demands of the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;WV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Grace|title=The Legendary Liner Lives Anew in Titanic: Adventure Out of Time - An interview with Writer/Producer Andrew Nelson|url=http://www2.worldvillage.com/wv/gamezone/html/feature/pulse/pulse6.htm|publisher=WorldVillage|accessdate=22 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971118152412/http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/gamezone/html/feature/pulse/pulse6.htm|archivedate=18 November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was inspired by a comment his wife Debi Lambert made about video games requiring too much time investment, leading his to pursue a race-against-the-clock game mechanic.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://titanicadventureoutoftime.wordpress.com/2013/06/21/in-focus-interview-with-producer-andrew-nelson/|title=In Focus: Interview with Producer Andrew Nelson|last=|first=|date=|website=titanic – adventure out of time: a dedicated fanblog|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629163815/https://titanicadventureoutoftime.wordpress.com/2013/06/21/in-focus-interview-with-producer-andrew-nelson/|archive-date=29 June 2013|dead-url=bot: unknown|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the subtitle was &quot;A Race Against Time&quot; to reflect this.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Nelson pitched the idea to CyberFlix as a &quot;Steam Punk star ship suspended in a vast void&quot;, to an enthused audience, and returned with a completed script after writing it over the summer in a [[New York City]] loft in [[SoHo, Manhattan|Soho]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; 

=== Development ===
CyberFlix's team spent two years researching to ensure the game would be authentic and historically accurate. ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' screenwriter [[William Broyles, Jr.]] served as a historical and photo researcher for the game, collaborating with CyberFlix in finding resources to faithfully re-create the ship and the period the game is set on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barracuda&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Titanic Web Site|website=Barracuda-gssm.com|publisher=Hammerhead Entertainment|accessdate=6 November 2015|url=http://www.barracuda-gssm.com/titanic/makingof.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818051425/http://www.barracuda-gssm.com/titanic/makingof.htm|archivedate=18 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broyles made an extensive use of the Internet and the [[Library of Congress]]'s online photo department to find historical photos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gamasutra&quot; /&gt;

Todd Appleton served as lead programmer.&lt;ref name=WV /&gt; The game was developed using CyberFlix's proprietary game engine and software DreamFactory, which was also used by the company to develop ''Dust: A Tale of the Wired West''. The engine allowed the developers to create 3D environments and script the characters so that they retain memory of the player's actions and react differently each time they encounter the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diller|first1=David E.|last2=Ferguson|first2=William |last3=Leung|first3=Alice M.|last4=Benyo|first4=Brett|last5=Foley|first5=Dennis |title=Behavior modeling in commercial games|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228864780_Behavior_modeling_in_commercial_games|journal=[[BBN Technologies]]|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=NG Alphas: Titanic|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=23 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=November 1996|pages=179–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wire-frame model]]s of the ''Titanic'', created by the [[Zygote Media Group]] in Utah, were textured and polished by graphical artists Michael Kennedy, Alex Tschetter and Paul Haskins. Bob Clouse and Billy Davenport were responsible for the 2D and interface design.&lt;ref name=Gamasutra&gt;{{cite web|last=Stern|first=Gloria|title=Interview With Andrew Nelson, Titanic's Producer |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3249/interview_with_andrew_nelson_.php|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=22 November 2015|date=16 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To create ''Titanic''{{'s}} character animation and movements, the developers cyberscaned multiple still photos of actors and overlaid them on the character's faces to create accurate facial and mouth movements.&lt;ref name=GameSpot /&gt;&lt;ref name=WVReview /&gt; CyberFlix used the proprietary software HeadShop to combine photography and animation, as opposed to video, for the characters; according to Nelson, the team was not able to use [[QuickTime]] for the characters &quot;as video takes up more disk space&quot; and only a few characters could be created.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gamasutra&quot;/&gt; The game's development took nineteen months, with CyberFlix finishing the game in November 1996.&lt;ref name=WV /&gt;&lt;ref name=MPO&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neely|first1=Jack|title=Game Over|url=http://monkeyfire.com/mpol/dir_zine/dir_1999/942/t_cover4.html|publisher=''[[Metro Pulse]]''|accessdate=22 July 2016|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GTE Entertainment]] picked the game for release after [[Viacom]] turned it down.&lt;ref name=MPO /&gt;

=== Music ===

The soundtrack was composed by Erik Holt, with Scott Scheinbaum serving as musical director. Holt cited as inspirations [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Joe Satriani]], and also studied composers that were popular in 1912, the game's time period, such as [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], to better evoke both the splendorous and melancholic atmosphere surrounding the ''Titanic'''s disaster.&lt;ref name=Barracuda /&gt;

Holt worked for three months on the game's core themes, mixing [[classical music|classical]] and early 20th-century music with elements of [[film score|cinematic score]]. Aside from its original music, the game also features Chopin's [[Preludes Op. 28 (Chopin)|Prelude Op. 28 No. 7]], which plays on the radio in the opening scene.&lt;ref name=Barracuda /&gt;

'''''The Last Express''''' is an [[Adventure video game|adventure]] [[video game]] designed by [[Jordan Mechner]] and published by [[Brøderbund]] in 1997 for PC. Players take on the role of an [[Americans|American]] who accepts an invite by a friend to join them on the [[Orient Express]], days before the start of [[World War I]], only to become involved in a maelstrom of treachery, lies, political conspiracies, personal interests, romance and murder, upon boarding the train. The game is unique in how it was created, its [[linearity (computer and video games)|non-linear]] story, and in how events in the game are conducted within [[Real-time (media)|real-time]].

The game was a [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial disappointment]] following its release, but received highly positive reviews and a positive post-release response. A [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] port was in development, but was cancelled before it was finished. The game was later reacquired by Mechner, who worked with [[DotEmu]] to make portable versions of the game for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and later released a remade version for [[Steam (software)|Steam]], entitled ''The Last Express - Gold Edition''.

== Gameplay ==
The game operates primarily from a first-person perspective of the story's lead character when they explore the train,&lt;ref name=&quot;NGenPre&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last=|first= |title=NG Alphas: The Last Express|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=25 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=January 1997|pages=105-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; with cutscenes being conducted in the third-person. Gameplay takes place almost entirely within [[Real-time (media)|real-time]], albeit accelerated by a factor of six;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gamasutra&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3862/the_last_express_revisiting_an_.php?page=1 |title=The Last Express: Revisiting An Unsung Classic |accessdate=2009-02-28 |author=Remo, Chris |date=2008-11-28 |publisher=Gamasutra |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221105721/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3862/the_last_express_revisiting_an_.php?page=1 |archivedate=2008-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the only time when it is not, is when the player's character sleeps at certain intervals and when the player is on the game's pause menu. Events within the game are scripted and thus occur at specific times denoted by the in-game clock - for example, a character leaving their compartment in order to go to the restaurant car in order to have lunch. When on the pause menu, the player can rewind time, either to a specific point, or to a specific destination on the express' route (i.e. Paris), but can fast forward to a later time, up until the current point in the story that they have reached.

The main areas of the game are within the carriages of the train, with the player able to look around each place they are in, move down corridors, enter and leave compartments, knock on doors, and talk to people. Items within the game can be interacted with, either to be examined, or in some cases, collected by the player for use later on. The game's story features around thirty characters, each of whom has their own [[artificial intelligence]] and individual agendas - as such they conduct actions that allow them to complete their own personal goals, only changing their plans due to player intervention -&lt;ref name=&quot;Behind the Scenes&quot;&gt;{{Cite video|title=The Last Express: Behind the Scenes |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gc4CXPEgoHg |medium=short film |publisher=Interplay |date=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the game using a non-linear approach of story-telling, in which the player's actions or in-actions, affect how the story plays out; the game's many events, led to its script being around 800 pages long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=282224432110 |title=In memoriam Tomi Pierce |accessdate=2011-07-12 |author=Mechner, Jordan |date=2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's story features multiple endings, depending on the player's actions. Around thirty of these are [[game over]]s, involving the main character being killed or arrested. Four are alternate endings, with only one of these being the &quot;true&quot; ending.

== Story ==
=== Setting ===
The game's story place in 1914, between 24-27 July, on the last journey made by the [[Orient Express]] from [[Paris]] to [[Constantinople]] (modern [[Istanbul]]) before the outbreak of [[World War I]]. Much of the game's events occur within the train itself, which consists of two baggage cars, a restaurant car, two sleeping cars, and a private car. The plot written for the game includes many elements of a mystery, including murder, secret plots and deals, lies and personal agendas, as well as featuring notable references to political climates in Europe.

=== Plot ===
Robert Cath, an American doctor on the run from the British and French police, both of whom suspect he was involved in the murder of an [[Ireland|Irish]] police officer, accepts an invite from his friend Tyler Whitney to join him on the Orient Express, in regards to an important deal he has made. Forced to board the train while it is heading out of Paris, Cath discovers Whitney dead in his compartment, with the only clues he finds being: a mysterious scroll written in [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and consisting of a simple fairytale; an elaborately designed box that is empty; and a purple and gold scarf with the letter &quot;W&quot; embroidered on it. Assuming his friend's identity and dealing with his body, Cath decides to investigate, and finds a few people of interest amongst the train's passengers: August Schmidt, a [[German Empire|German]] arms dealer whom Whitney had been in contact with; Anna Wolff, an [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] violinist whom Cath has suspicions about; Vassili Obolensky, a Russian count travelling with his granddaughter, Tatiana Obolenskaya; Alexei Dolnikov, a Russian [[Anarchism in Russia|anarchist]] and a childhood friend of Tatiana; and Sophie de Bretheuill and Rebecca Norton, a pair of women travelling together. Sometime after dinner is served, Cath finds himself invited to meet with Kronos, an mysterious art collector travelling in a private car with his African servant Kahina, who reveals that Whitney had arranged to exchange an item called the &quot;Firebird&quot; for a large sum of gold, and that he is aware of who Cath is. Shortly after the meeting, Cath finds himself encountering Milos Jovanovic, a Serbian travelling with a group of associates, who mistakenly believes he murdered Whitney until Cath sets him straight, only to learn that his friend had made a deal with him, but learns little on the details. Unable to sleep that night, Cath visits Anna in her compartment upon finding she is still awake, only to be forced at gunpoint to reveal who he is when she informs him that she knows he is not Whitney, having been in his friend's compartment upon his arrival on the train. Anna finds herself forced to drop the matter after the pair overhear Obolensky having a nervous attack. Shortly after Cath helps to treat him as best as he can, he eavesdrop on Anna asking Tatiana to look after something important.

The next day, Cath has a meeting with Milos, who reveals that he and his associate are part of a Serbian outfit called the Black Hand, and learns of the agreement made between Whitney and a Serbian general. Having helped with supporting foreign liberty causes, Whitney had agreed to supply a large cache of weapons to the Serbians, and was given one of Serbia's national treasures to help with the purchase - an elaborately designed music box called the Firebird, which assumes the form of a golden egg when closed, but when opened in a special way, transforms into a beautiful singing mechanical bird, and a whistle designed in the form of a scarab beetle. Whitney had arranged to sell the treasure to Kronos, in exchange for gold coins that he would then use to purchase the arms from Schmidt. With no gold and the treasure missing, Cath finds he must recover them and complete the deal with Schmidt, or face severe consequences. After the meeting, Cath has another meeting with Kronos, whom he finds to be a dangerous and ruthless man, while recovering the whistle from a young French boy, travelling with his family, after he had found it in one of the cars. After the Express departs from Munich with Schmidt's weapons, Cath encounters an Englishman named George Abbot, who is notably inquisitive of his actions the previous night, but also points out certain details that make him uneasy about Abbot's intentions. When Kronos arranges for most of the passengers to attend a small concert in his private car, Cath takes advantage of it to search the compartments of the sleeping cars, finding a letter in Anna's possessions that exposes her as an Austrian spy, and another letter in Schmidt's luggage that makes him suspicious of why he is supplying the Serbians with weapons, before eventually finding the Firebird in Tatiana's compartment, having been entrusted with it by Anna when she found it in Whitney's compartment. Not trusting Kronos, Cath hides the treasure, and then finds his way into Kronos' private chambers in order to borrow the gold he brought along, in order to keep the deal with Schmidt in place. After being forced to return the gold to Kronos at gunpoint before he must leave the train at Vienna, Cath later prevents the Serbians from killing Anna when she decides to investigate the baggage car. Despite him saving her, Anna reveals she was on the train to uncover what the Black Hand were up to, and plans to inform the Austrian authorities at Budapest.

Shortly after the train departs Vienna, Tatiana informs Cath that Alexei intends to murder her grandfather, in regards to certain injustices made against Alexei's father, by detonating a bomb placed on the train. Agreeing to help, Cath finds a detonator within Alexei's compartment and removes it to prevent the bomb being used. Later that night, Cath awakens to a disturbance, and finds Alexei fatally wounded in Obolensky's compartment during a confrontation between the two men; his death mentally scars Tatiana as a direct result. Shortly after finding and defusing a second bomb Alexei crafted, Cath meets with Abbot and discovers him to be a British spy, who had boarded the train to track down a Russian anarchist; knowing who Cath is, Abbott reveals that he suspects him to be innocent in the murder in Ireland, and so offers to clear his name as a result of his actions when he gets into contact with the British authorities. Cath soon visits Anna in her compartment, and the pair share an intimate kiss together. Just as the train begins to reach Budapest, Milos orders the Black Hand to takeover the train and keep it moving, while holding the passengers and staff prisoner, and having Cath and Anna put into the train's rear baggage car. Freeing himself, Cath releases Anna, before dealing with the Serbians, and releasing the passengers and staff, all of whom return to the sleeping cars, except for Abbot, Tatiana, Obolensky, and Anna. Cath then separates the sleeping cars from the train, but not before informing Schmidt of who he really is and that he had been set up by the Germans and Austrians into selling weapons to the Serbians, in order to give both countries an excuse to invade the Balklands. Proceeding to the locomotive, Cath confronts Milos, who is promptly shot by Anna, before keeping the train going and refusing to be stopped by Anna. After the group cross the border into Serbia and narrowly escape pursuit by a Serbian military train, Anna reluctantly accepts the situation and shares a passionate night with Cath.

As the train slowly begins to reach its final destination at Constantinople, Cath and Anna find themselves encountering Kronos and Kahina, both of whom had secretly followed the train and re-boarded it when it had stopped at a station. Revealing that they seek to possess the Firebird and knowing that Cath still has it, Kronos orders him at gunpoint to retrieve it and then open it in his presence, before forcing Anna to play her violin and make it sing. Satisfied that he finally has what he wants and seeing the sun setting, Kronos orders the Firebird to be closed, but Cath refuses. Instead, he blows on the treasure's whistle, causing the Firebird to become a living weapon and lash out against Kronos and Kahina and kill both of them, revealing to Cath how Whitney had died; in the chaos that is caused, both he and Anna jump from the train, just as it pulls into Constantinople. A disturbed Tatiana, wishing for no more bloodshed, soon finds explosives amongst the Serbians' weapons and uses Alexei's lighter to detonate them, killing herself, Abbot and Obolensky, and destroying the train. As Cath and Anna survey the devastation, the pair overhear a Turkish boy crying out that war has broken out in Europe. Revealing that she must return home, Anna promises Robert that she will see him again when the war is over, before parting ways with him.

==History==
Mechner founded Smoking Car Productions to create ''The Last Express''. The company was located in San Francisco from 1993–1997 and at its peak had sixty full-time employees.

Mechner saw ''The Last Express'' as an opportunity to create a game with a complexity of story and depth of characters comparable to that seen in a film, something he felt he could not accomplish with his games for the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] due to hardware limitations.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGenInt&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last=|first= |title=An Interview with Jordan Mechner|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=25 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=January 1997|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said of the game's approach to storytelling: {{quote|There's a built-in tension between making a game that's interactive and has a story. ... With a game like this, the goal is to create, to a certain degree, the illusion of interactivity. You want the player to feel that actions really have consequences. Choosing from multiple branches is not fun. You feel like you're on a branching tree just picking different ways to go, and that's not a game. You have to give players the feeling they really are somewhere, like on a train, and that they can walk down a corridor and open any door and see someone walking and follow them. Yet somehow we have to set things so players are always in the same story, and, when they get to the ending, they feel that's the way it should have ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGenInt&quot;/&gt;}}

===Art production ===
[[Image:TLE Rotoscope Example.png|thumb|right|The progression from storyboard to finished scene, top to bottom. Note the distinctive &quot;clown&quot; makeup and lined costumes used on the actors.]]
The game is notable for its unique art style, with characters illustrated in the &quot;[[art nouveau]]&quot; style that was popular in 1914, the year the game's events take place.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGenPre&quot;/&gt; Since illustrating a game of this magnitude by hand would most likely take an exorbitant amount of time, the look was achieved by using [[rotoscoping]], a process that Mechner had used in ''[[Prince of Persia (1989 video game)|Prince of Persia]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGenInt&quot;/&gt; During a 22-day-long live-action video shoot, every action by every character in the game was photographed by actors wearing distinctive makeup and costumes against a [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] on [[16mm film]] and digitized. From this, a limited number of frames were selected and put through a patented process developed in house, where the frames first had all colour removed. Then, a powerful computer program created black-and-white line drawings of the frames, which were then coloured in by hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Behind the Scenes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barba, Rick: The Last Express: The Official Strategy Guide, page 194, Prima Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The finished product has 40,000 frames in total.&lt;ref&gt;Back of box, Brøderbund release of The Last Express, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Publishing ===
Following a bidding war between several major game publishers, [[Brøderbund]], [[SoftBank]], and GameBank split the worldwide distribution rights for the game. Dubbed versions of the game were released in [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] ([[Fan translation of video games|unofficial bootlegged localization]]) and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

=== Release ===
The game was released 1997 after five years of development, at a final cost of US$5–6{{nbsp}}million,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gamasutra&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffiths |first=Diana |title=Mark Moran joins Diana for a chat in the smoking car of The Last Express... |work=Games Domain (archived) |date=June 1997 |url=http://personal.markmoran.net/Programming/GamesDomainInterview.html |accessdate=September 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060604002242/http://personal.markmoran.net/Programming/GamesDomainInterview.html |archivedate=June 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on a multi-platform 3-CD set that covered [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Mac OS]], and [[MS-DOS]]. ''The Last Express'' received highly positive [[review]]s both in print and online. However, the game only remained in stores for a few months.

Brøderbund did little to promote the game, apart from a brief mention in a press release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broderbund Software – Press News |publisher=Coming Soon Magazine |url=http://www.csoon.com/issue26/p_redor1.htm |accessdate=2006-08-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030214122/http://www.csoon.com/issue26/p_redor1.htm |archivedate=2006-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and enthusiastic statements by Brøderbund executives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Conference Call, 03/27/97: Broderbund Q2 |publisher=The Motley Fool |url=http://www.fool.com/Calls/1997/Calls970327b.htm |accessdate=2006-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013170236/http://www.fool.com/calls/1997/calls970327b.htm |archivedate=2007-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in part due to the entire Brøderbund marketing team quitting in the weeks before its release.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gamasutra&quot;/&gt; Softbank pulled out of the game market, dissolving its subsidiary GameBank and canceling several dozen titles in development, including the nearly finished [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] [[porting|port]] of ''The Last Express''. As a final blow, Brøderbund was acquired by [[The Learning Company]], which was not interested in ''The Last Express''. Within a year of its release, ''The Last Express'' was [[Orphan work|out of print]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/the-games-that-time-forgot-br-the-last-express-26143.phtml |title=The Games That Time Forgot: The Last Express |accessdate=2011-07-12 |author=Burch, Anthony |date=2006-08-15 |publisher=Destructoid |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116201350/http://www.destructoid.com/the-games-that-time-forgot-br-the-last-express-26143.phtml |archivedate=2011-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Mechner's company [[Smoking Car Productions]] quietly folded.

=== Re-release ===
In 2000, the [[Fallout (series)|''Fallout'' video game series]] creator and game publisher [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]] bought the lapsed rights and began quietly selling the game as a budget title. A short time later, Interplay went [[bankrupt]], so the game was once again [[orphaned work|out of print]]. In 2006, the American subscription-based game service [[GameTap]] began offering the game on its network.

On January 14, 2011, DotEmu released the ''[[Special edition|Collector's Edition]]'' of the game, which includes the soundtrack, a [[making-of]] video and a [[Strategy guide|walkthrough]].&lt;ref name=TLECEDE/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bit-tech.net/news/gaming/2011/01/14/the-last-express-re-released/ |title=The Last Express re-released |date=2011-01-14 |author=Joe Martin |publisher=[[bit-tech]] |accessdate=2014-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111233644/http://www.bit-tech.net/news/gaming/2011/01/14/the-last-express-re-released/ |archivedate=2014-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 26, 2011, Phoenix Licensing (the current copyright holder of the game) re-released the game in [[GOG.com]], with all the extras of the ''Collector's Edition'' –except the walkthrough– and only in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gog.com/news/surprise_release_the_last_express/ |title=Surprise release: The Last Express |date=2011-01-26 |author=[[GOG.com]] |publisher=[[CD Projekt]] |accessdate=2014-01-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112010704/http://www.gog.com/news/surprise_release_the_last_express |archivedate=2014-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobile ports ===
Mechner was later able to reacquire the rights to the game and worked in 2012 with [[DotEmu]] to release [[iOS]] and Android ports of the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/03/16/all-aboard-the-last-express-on-ios-mechners-classic-adventure/ |title=All aboard The Last Express on iOS, Mechner's classic adventure revamped |publisher=Joystiq |first=Jessica |last=Conduit |date=2012-03-16 |accessdate=2013-02-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901070320/http://www.joystiq.com/2012/03/16/all-aboard-the-last-express-on-ios-mechners-classic-adventure/ |archivedate=2013-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 16, 2012, Mechner announced an upcoming release of the game for [[iOS]] devices, with &quot;additional enhancements to make it more iOS-friendly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mechner |first=Jordan |authorlink=Jordan Mechner |title=Announcing Last Express for iOS |date=March 16, 2012 |url=http://www.jordanmechner.com/blog/2012/03/tle-ios/ |accessdate=March 18, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319014228/http://jordanmechner.com/blog/2012/03/tle-ios/ |archivedate=March 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[iOS]] version (iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch) of the games was released on September 27 by DotEmu.com and is available in the App Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dotemu.com/en/download-game/4790/the-last-express-ios |title=The Last Express (iOS) |accessdate=2011-07-12 |date=2012-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002130202/http://www.dotemu.com/en/download-game/4790/the-last-express-ios |archivedate=2012-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A version for Android was released on August 28, 2013 through the [[Google Play Store]].

On November 21, 2013, DotEmu released also a ''Gold Edition'' for PC on [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. It adds improved [[user interface]] and inventory, advanced hint system, achievements and cloud save support.&lt;ref name=TLEGE/&gt;

== Soundtrack ==
Running thirty-nine minutes, the [[Soundtrack album|soundtrack]] for ''The Last Express'' was published by [[Intrada Records]] in 2000, but is no longer in print. It was composed, orchestrated and conducted by American composer born in Czechoslovakia, [[Elia Cmiral]], who later composed the scores for ''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'' and ''[[Stigmata (film)|Stigmata]]''. Consisting of a mix of dominant synth instruments and occasional solo violin, the score was recorded at Forte Muzika Studios in Los Angeles. The lone exception is the [[Violin Sonata (Franck)|Sonata for Violin and Piano in A major]] by [[César Franck]] featured in the game's concert scene.

As of May 2011, the soundtrack is included as a digital release given away free with the [[DotEmu]] and [[GOG.com]] versions of ''The Last Express''.

== Reception and impact ==
''The Last Express'' received highly positive [[review]]s both in print and online. [[Newsweek]] called it &quot;exquisite&quot; and &quot;thrilling&quot; and [[MSNBC]] said &quot;the mystery and characters are very fascinating&quot; and &quot;this game is definitely for everyone&quot;. ''Games Magazine'' declared it the Best New Adventure and Role Playing Game, and it received Editor's Choice awards from [[PC Gamer]], [[Computer Gaming World]], Next Generation, and dozens of game websites, including a gold medal from GamesDomain. In 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book ''[[1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die|last=Mott |first=Tony |authorlink= |year=2010 |publisher=[[Quintessence Editions Ltd.]]|location=London |isbn=978-1-74173-076-0 |page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The editors of ''[[Macworld]]'' named ''The Last Express'' the best role-playing game of 1997. [[Steven Levy]] and Cameron Crotty of the magazine wrote, &quot;What makes ''The Last Express'' vividly memorable is the painstaking detail, particularly the lush score and the faithfully rendered sounds of the most famous train ever. So while you may never solve this three-disc conundrum, you'll never forget the ride.&quot;&lt;ref name=macworld1997&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011127213059/http://www.macworld.com/1998/01/features/4088.html |url=http://www.macworld.com:80/1998/01/features/4088.html |title=1998 Macintosh Game Hall of Fame |author1=Levy, Steven |author2=Crotty, Cameron |authorlink1=Steven Levy |work=[[Macworld]] |date=January 1998 |archivedate=November 27, 2001 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Last Express'' was a runner-up for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s 1997 &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot; award, which ultimately went to ''[[The Curse of Monkey Island]]''. The editors called ''The Last Express'' &quot;the year's best mystery&quot; and &quot;stylish and intriguing&quot;.&lt;ref name=cgwpremier1997&gt;{{cite journal | author=Staff | journal=[[Computer Gaming World]] | title=''CGW'' Presents The Best &amp; Worst of 1997 |date=March 1998 | issue=164 | pages=74-77, 80, 84, 88, 89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a finalist for [[GameSpot]]'s 1997 &quot;Best Adventure Game&quot; award, which again went to ''The Curse of Monkey Island''. The editors wrote, &quot;While a few minor gameplay problems held it back from the top spot, there is no doubt that ''The Last Express'' is one of the best adventure games of the last few years.&quot;&lt;ref name=gamespot1997&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816000042/http://www.gamespot.com/features/awards97/index.html |url=http://www.gamespot.com:80/features/awards97/index.html |title=GameSpot's Best &amp; Worst Awards for 1997 |author=Staff |work=[[GameSpot]] |archivedate=August 16, 2000 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the positive reception, the game was a [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]]. Released in April, the game sold only about 100,000 copies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mark Moran – Programming – Interviews |publisher=Mark Moran |url=http://personal.markmoran.net/Programming/Interviews.html |accessdate=2006-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225002933/http://personal.markmoran.net/Programming/Interviews.html |archivedate=2007-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a million copies short of breaking even.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Moran – Programming – The Last Express |publisher=Mark Moran |url=http://personal.markmoran.net/Programming/LastExpress.html |accessdate=2006-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060604002501/http://personal.markmoran.net/Programming/LastExpress.html |archivedate=2006-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, ''[[Computer Games Magazine|Computer Games Strategy Plus]]'' named ''The Last Express'' one of the &quot;10 Essential Graphic Adventures&quot;. The magazine's Steve Bauman wrote, &quot;While it received terrific reviews, and its innovative storytelling engine should have pointed toward a bold new future for interactive fiction, it had disastrously low sales, essentially bankrupting the company that produced it and telling the industry consumers weren't interested in this type of game.&quot;&lt;ref name=cgm10adventures&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205051027/http://www.cdmag.com/articles/025/186/adventure_feature.html |url=http://www.cdmag.com:80/articles/025/186/adventure_feature.html |title=10 Essential Graphic Adventures |author=Bauman, Steve |date=January 29, 2000 |work=[[Computer Games Magazine|Computer Games Strategy Plus]] |archivedate=February 5, 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film adaptation ===
On April 13, 2010, [[MTV]]'s Movies Blog posted an excerpt from a recent interview with Dutch film director [[Paul Verhoeven]]. In the interview, Verhoeven is quoted as saying, &quot;I am working on a movie now that is... situated in 1914. Basically, [[Indiana Jones]]-ish you could say, but also [[Hitchcockian]].&quot; He also states that the source material is a video game, and that &quot;the writer of the video game has asked me to keep [the identity of the game] secret until he has a script.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EXCLUSIVE: Paul Verhoeven Pushes Play On Video Game Adaptation Set In 1914 |first=Adam |last=Rosenberg |newspaper=MTV Movies Blog |date=April 13, 2010 |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/04/13/exclusive-paul-verhoeven-pushes-play-on-video-game-adaptation-set-in-1914/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416204107/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/04/13/exclusive-paul-verhoeven-pushes-play-on-video-game-adaptation-set-in-1914/ |archivedate=April 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, several other websites speculated that the video game in question is ''The Last Express'', considering the relative dearth of games set in 1914, as well as Jordan Mechner's work on the film version of ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (film)|Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paul Verhoeven Developing Big Screen Adaptation of… Jordan Mechner’s Video Game The Last Express? |first=Peter |last=Sciretta |newspaper=/Film |date=April 13, 2010 |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2010/04/13/paul-verhoeven-developing-big-screen-adaptation-of-jordan-mechners-video-game-the-last-express/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416173807/http://www.slashfilm.com/2010/04/13/paul-verhoeven-developing-big-screen-adaptation-of-jordan-mechners-video-game-the-last-express/ |archivedate=April 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paul Verhoeven Bringing ‘The Last Express’ To The Big Screen? |first=Sandy |last=Schaefer |newspaper=Screen Rant |date=April 14, 2010 |url=http://screenrant.com/paul-verhoeven-video-game-movie-last-express-sandy-54220/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417111720/http://screenrant.com/paul-verhoeven-video-game-movie-last-express-sandy-54220/ |archivedate=April 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, Verhoeven confirmed that he is working with Mechner to develop a film adaptation of the game. The film would most likely be filmed in 3D, although it may not be Verhoeven's immediate next project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=&quot;3D Could Become as Normal as Colour&quot; – Paul Verhoeven |newspaper=3D Focus |date=October 11, 2011 |url=http://www.3dfocus.co.uk/3d-news-2/3d-film/3d-could-become-as-normal-as-colour-paul-verhoeven/5839 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027191947/http://www.3dfocus.co.uk/3d-news-2/3d-film/3d-could-become-as-normal-as-colour-paul-verhoeven/5839 |archivedate=October 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Urban Runner''''' (originally subtitled ''Lost In Town'') is a French produced&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207181&lt;/ref&gt; computer game developed by [[Coktel Vision]] and published by [[Sierra On-line]].

The game is an [[interactive movie]] spanning four [[CD-ROM]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Moby Games| title=Urban Runner | year=2006|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/urban-runner/| publisher=Mobygames.com | accessdate=2006-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot follows an American journalist in Paris who has been framed for murder during the course of an investigation.

''Urban Runner'' was not very popular at the time of its release, due to high graphics and monitor resolution requirements. The minimum requirement was 640×480, with 256 colors. For the best quality, 640×480, 32-bit color was needed. Few reviews have been published concerning the game.

The lead is played by ''Brandon Massey'', who also played the lead in the Sierra title [[Police Quest IV: Open Season]] (1993), making this his second and final appearance in a Sierra game.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1083018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
You are Max Gardner (''Brandon Massey''), an American journalist in Paris, investigating a story about a big drug dealer who is covered by some influential politician. To get the dealer talking, you offer him incriminating photographs in exchange for some information. When Max arrives at the meeting point, the drug lord is dead and Max is mistaken for the killer.

While evading the authorities, Max continues his investigation and finds an ally in Adda - the murdered drug dealer's lover - and the two of them work to uncover the conspiracy behind the murders.

==Gameplay==

The game itself is an interactive movie controlled with a mouse. As with many games of this type the player progresses by collecting items, talking to characters and solving puzzles. The player will also accumulate Clues - pieces of information which are essential to solving the mystery - which are separate from the inventory and cannot be given away or lost.

Should the player be having difficulty in progressing, they begin the game with three '''Jokers''' to use, which act as a hint system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Sierra | title=Urban Runner - Manual - PC | year=1996 | url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:FSIpQs4k6tYJ:archives.scovetta.com/pub/game_programming/agi/documents/Manuals/Urban_Runner_-_Manual.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjxde8iFofz_KCwam84m3SPXmZqEntTfvkC2-wPRzGKVaLXN7qv6KtMVM5AVv2QFTyPLvUCDIJvbuQ3LqPXAAXs4ftp20ZOAiE4CJlKv1zYvCidsuxKTX_mxKskzMWlMuMK7Ew6&amp;sig=AHIEtbRQEKSZpskXVJ1PH6aQ8h245eWuGw| publisher=Google Docs | accessdate=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The player's viewpoint switches from Max to Adda at certain points in the game and sometimes gives the player a choice of which character to control. However, both characters must have the puzzles in their respective areas solved to progress.

Gameplay can be divided into '''Clue''' and '''Action''' sections. '''Clue''' sections are puzzle-based with no time limit; players may have to explore an environment, talk to characters or interact with objects to progress. '''Action''' sections give the player a short amount of time to make a decision - making the wrong choice usually results in your character's death.

== Compatibility ==

''Urban Runner'' was developed to run under [[MS-DOS|DOS]] and [[Windows 3.1]], making it incompatible with modern [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] computers. However, it is fully playable using the [[game engine recreation]] software [[ScummVM]], as part of its support for the ''Gob'' engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=ScummVM| title=Urban Runner - ScummVM :: Wiki | url=http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Urban_Runner | publisher=Mobygames.com | accessdate=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which is used for games developed by Coktel Vision)

'''''Harvester''''' is a 1996 [[point-and-click adventure game]] written and directed by Gilbert P. Austin, known for its violent content, cult following, and examination of the relationship between fictional violence and actual violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elston|first=Brett|title=The bloodiest games you've never played|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-bloodiest-games-youve-never-played/?page=3|publisher=Games Radar|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storyline ==
The game stars Steve, who awakes with a case of amnesia in a strange town in 1953 called Harvest. He can't remember anything from his past and when he tells the people that claim to be his family, as well as towns people, they all tell him what a &quot;kidder&quot; he is. All of the town inhabitants are extremely eccentric and many appear to be more a satire or stereotype than real people. They all continuously stress to Steve that he should join the Lodge, which is a large building located at the center of town that serves as the headquarters of the Order of the [[harvest moon|Harvest Moon]]. Steve visits the [[Sergeant at Arms]] at the Lodge, who tells him that all of his questions will be answered inside the building. To enter, he must first join the Order of the Harvest Moon. But in order to join, he must perform a series of tasks that range from simple vandalism to arson for his initiation.

While snooping around town, performing these various tasks and learning more about this bizarre and corrupt town, Steve visits the Pottsdam residence. Here he meets the overweight and perverted Mr. Pottsdam, who tells Steve that he is to marry his daughter, Stephanie, in a few weeks. Steve meets his alleged wife-to-be upstairs and she explains that she has amnesia as well, and, like Steve, notices that something doesn't seem right about the town. Over a series of days Steve successfully performs all of the required tasks and when he visits Stephanie in her room, he finds nothing but a mutilated skull and spinal cord. He takes it to the Sergeant of Arms and asks him if this is really the remains of Stephanie, to which the Sergeant explains that, inside the Lodge, he will learn the truth, and grants Steve access.

Inside the Lodge Steve visits three floors consisting of mayhem and murder. He must solve various puzzles along the way as well as visit different rooms, referred to as “temples” by their occupants, where he must take on several moral decisions. Eventually he makes it to the Inner Sanctum, where he talks to Principal Herrill of Harvest's Gein Memorial School, who explains that he is second in command of the Harvest Order and is to be addressed as Vice Muck Herrill. The head of the Harvest Order, the Grand Muckity Muck, shares a few short words with Steve, and then attacks him. Steve successfully kills the Grand Muckity Muck and meets the Sergeant at Arms one last time.

He reveals Stephanie to him, who is alive but hooked up to a special torture device, which gave her pain whenever Steve climbed a rope in the Lodge. He releases her from the device and explains to Steve that everything in Harvest is created by a [[virtual reality]] simulator, which he and Stephanie are hooked up to. The Sergeant at Arms explains that this simulation was created in hopes of successfully turning Steve into a [[serial killer]] in [[real life]]. He then gives Steve a final ultimatum: Marry and live out the rest of his life and die of old age with Stephanie in the virtual reality that is Harvest or kill Stephanie, where she will die in real life but Steve will be released and free to live in the real world as a serial killer.

If the player chooses to kill Stephanie, they are then shown a film sequence during which Steve beats Stephanie to death and then removes her skull and spinal cord. After the murder is complete, Steve awakens within the virtual reality simulator. Then the player see Steve hitchhiking in a car where he brutally murders the driver. Steve returns home, where he plays ''Harvester'' with his computer. His mother disapproves the game and criticizes violence in video games by saying that people who watch violence commit violence. Steve ridicules his mother's assertions and laughs at her comparison of violent media to &quot;[[Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner|Road Runner cartoons]].&quot;

If the player chooses to spare Stephanie's life, the Sergeant at Arms expresses disappointment that Steve would choose this ending. Steve says that he'd rather die than become a serial killer, to which the Sergeant at Arms responds that he should enjoy his life &quot;such as it is&quot;. The player then views a sequence of clips during which Steve marries Stephanie in a ceremony officiated by the Sergeant at Arms and the two have a child together. Their graves are then shown, followed by the death of their bodies in real life as their virtual lives only lasted a few minutes.

== Gameplay==
The game utilizes a [[point and click]] interface. Players must visit various locations within the game's fictional town of Harvest via an overhead map. By speaking to various townspeople and clicking on special &quot;hotspots&quot;, players can learn information and collect items that progress the game's story and play. ''Harvester'' also features a fighting system where players can attack other characters by selecting a weapon and then clicking on the target. Both the target and the player's character have a limited amount of health available, allowing for either the player or the target to die. Players can choose to progress through the game by solving puzzles or by killing one of the non-playable characters.

== Development and controversy ==
''Harvester'' was first announced to public at the [[Consumer Electronics Show|Consumer Electronics Show (CES)]] in January 1994 in Las Vegas. The dark and blasphemous content of the game drew a huge amount of attention and created a lot of expectations. The writer/director Gilbert P. Austin was against any kind of [[censorship]] and he wanted the game to serve as an examination of the controversy about whether violence in media creates, or is created by, violence in society. Austin finished the creative work in autumn 1994 and moved on to the other projects. The game was set to be released the same year but was instead delayed two years and became a commercial failure. However the game managed to cause controversy. One scene in which children cannibalize their mother was censored in Europe, and in Germany, the game was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weirdretro.org.uk/captains-blog/retro-gaming-harvester-1996|title=Retro Gaming: Harvester (1996)|website=Weird Retro|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today ''Harvester'' is known for its [[cult following]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gogcom.tumblr.com/post/92424446858/harvester-gilbert-austin-interview|title=Inside Harvester - A Fan Interview with Gilbert P.

== Cult following==
''Harvester'' has a fan page on Facebook which produces and releases interviews with the designers and actors of the game.&lt;ref name=AM /&gt; The fan page releases behind-the-scenes photos, unused graphics, old advertisements, and other fan material.

On YouTube, &quot;The Harvester Show&quot; presents and analyzes the original material used to create the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHQSkQrFoJWuOxO_Jr7mvkg|title=Lodge Level 4|website=YouTube|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dark Seed II''''' is a [[psychological horror]] [[Graphic adventure game#Point-and-click adventure|point-and-click adventure game]] developed and published by [[Cyberdreams]] in 1995, and is the sequel to the 1992 game ''[[Dark Seed (video game)|Dark Seed]]''. It sees recurring protagonist Mike Dawson's continued adventures in the [[H.R. Giger]] artwork-based &quot;Dark World.&quot; Designed and written by future James Bond novelist [[Raymond Benson]], the game was released for Microsoft Windows 3.x, Sega Saturn, and Sony PlayStation. As was the case with ''Dark Seed'', console versions of ''Dark Seed II'' were released only in Japan, though they were additionally fully dubbed in Japanese. Unlike the original game, the Saturn version of ''Dark Seed II'' does not support the Saturn mouse.

==Development==
[[David Mullich]] was the producer and oversaw development of the game, while Raymond Benson wrote its script, dialog, and puzzles,&lt;ref name=&quot;Let's Play Archive Index&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lparchive.org/Darkseed-2/Bonus/|title=Darkseed 2 #55 - Bonus Chapter|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose writing drew influence from that of [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Twin Peaks]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Let's Play Archive Index&quot; /&gt; Incidentally, H. R. Giger did not produce any original artwork for ''Dark Seed II''; artwork that he had previously created was licensed for use in the game. While the character of Mike Dawson was played in the first ''Dark Seed'' by actual game developer Mike Dawson, the character in ''Dark Seed II'' is instead portrayed by an actor named Chris Gilbert.&lt;ref name=&quot;Let's Play Archive Index&quot; /&gt;

==Storyline==
Although Mike Dawson saved the world from the &quot;Ancients&quot; in ''Dark Seed'', the experience causes him to undergo a mental breakdown. He returns to his childhood hometown of [[Crowley, Texas]] in an attempt to regain his sanity, and moves in with his mother. A year goes by, and Mike is still suffering from serious mental scarring and memory lapses. Worse, Rita, his girlfriend, is found murdered after their high school reunion, and the entire town of Crowley seems convinced that Mike is the culprit, with the exception of his friend Jack. It is evident the &quot;Ancients&quot; have returned, and the only way for Mike to clear his name is by venturing between alternate realities and solving their mysteries, while simultaneously stopping the Ancients from taking over the world.

If Mike dies at any point in the game, he is sent to the Underworld and meets the Keeper of the Souls, who states that Mike is destined to die. If Mike loses another life, he will return to the Underworld and plunge into a River of Blood, while the Keeper of the Scrolls informs the player that the Ancients have consequently created a monster called the &quot;Behemoth,&quot; and that it has sucked the &quot;life force&quot; from earth. This will also happen near the game's finale if Mike fails to clear the Dark World mirror maze ahead of the Behemoth, allowing it to cross over into the &quot;Light World&quot; where it becomes immortal.

Mike enters the Dark World counterpart of his home, identical to it in the Light World, and after a seemingly normal greeting from his &quot;mother,&quot; her head violently explodes. Mike then sees Rita's head shrouded in the vapors of his mom's cooking, who explains about the Behemoth and that the &quot;Sword&quot; is powerful enough to kill it. Mike obtains the Sword from the Keeper of the Sword, and the Keeper of the Scrolls advises him to take a shortcut through the Dark World mirror maze. If he succeeds, he will successfully kill the monster with his Sword.

Afterward, Mike blows up the Ancients' spaceship, and the Keeper of the Scrolls congratulates him. He wakes up in his psychiatrist's office and finds Jack next to the deceased doctor's body. Mike comes to the realization that Jack is his Dark World counterpart and gets stabbed by him, dying. Sheriff Butler and his deputy enter the scene and, apparently oblivious to Jack's presence, arrive at the conclusion of Mike having committed suicide and indeed being responsible for all the murders that occurred through course of the game. Jack is then seen exiting via the Dark World, leaving it ambiguous as to whether the events of the game really happened or were part of Mike's delusions.

{{nihongo|'''''Shadow of Memories'''''|シャドウ・オブ・メモリーズ|Shadou obu Memorīzu}} ('''''Shadow of Destiny''''' in North America) is an [[adventure game]] developed by [[Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo]] and published by [[Konami]]. Originally released for the [[PlayStation 2]] in 2001, it was later ported to [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] (which is only released in Europe) and [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2002. A [[PlayStation Portable]] version was released on October 1, 2009 in Japan and on January 26, 2010 in North America.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Shadow of Memories (1902 timeline - screenshot).jpg|thumb|left|The color tone varies depending on which era Eike time-travels to. For example, the early twentieth century is depicted in grey tones while 1580 appears in earth-colored ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpot review&quot;/&gt;]]

The objective of ''Shadow of Memories'' is to guide [[player character]] Eike Kusch through the fictional [[Germany|German]] town of Lebensbaum (Life's Tree) as he travels through time to prevent and unmask his murderer.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN review&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/03/07/shadow-of-destiny-2 |title=Shadow of Destiny (PS2) |date=March 6, 2001 |author=Zdyrko, David |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game takes place in three parts: a prologue, eight chapters, and an epilogue.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpot review&quot;/&gt; In the prologue and each chapter, Eike dies, is resurrected by the [[non-player character]] [[Homunculus]], and travels back in time before his death with the intent of changing events to prevent it. ''Shadow of Memories'' lacks traditional action elements,&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpot review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN review&quot;/&gt; and Eike cannot attack nor does he have a bar displaying his [[Health (gaming)|health]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpot review&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shadow-of-destiny-review/1900-2694612/ |title=Shadow of Destiny Review (PS2) |date=March 9, 2001 |author=Vestal, Andrew |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digipad, a time-traveling item given to Eike by Homunculus, requires energy units, which the player can find scattered around the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPG Fan&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/shadowofdestiny/Shadow_of_Destiny.html |title=Shadow of Destiny |date=March 7, 2001 |author=Dancin' Homer |publisher=RPGFan |accessdate=February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gameplay primarily consists of time-traveling through the different eras, finding items, and interacting through dialogue with the non-player characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpot review&quot;/&gt; Actions taken in one time period affect future ones; for example, if Eike removes a seal from the squire's manor in 1580, the seal will not appear in the present era.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpot review&quot;/&gt;

Additionally, the game keeps two digital clocks: one depicting the time in the present-day era and another for whichever era Eike time-travels to.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPG Fan&quot;/&gt; The amount of time Eike spends in the different eras also passes in the present-day one.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpot review&quot;/&gt; The [[cut-scenes]] and dialogue takes up varying amounts of in-game time.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPG Fan&quot;/&gt; When the clock arrives at the time of Eike's death, the chapter restarts, however, if Eike is not in his time period at the time of his death, the game ends.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPG Fan&quot;/&gt;

== Plot ==
Set in a fictional [[Germany|German]] town named Lebensbaum (Life's Tree), ''Shadow of Memories'' revolves around a 22-year-old man named Eike Kusch, who dies in the beginning of the game from being stabbed after leaving a small diner. However, he is resurrected by Homunculus (voiced by [[Charles Martinet]] in English), a [[djinn]] or genie, who offers to send him back in time to prevent his death and gives him the time-traveling digipad. Eike explores four eras—2001, 1979/1980, 1902 and 1580 to 1584 — as he attempts to unmask his killer and figure out a way of stopping his own murder at various points in the present. Along the way he encounters several characters: Dana, a modern-day waitress whom he accidentally brings back to the year 1580 and loses; the present-day [[fortune teller]], who tells Eike the hour of his death; Eckart Brum, the curator of a private [[art museum]] who lost his wife and infant daughter in a shooting; Dr. Wolfgang Wagner, an alchemist living in 1580 with his wife, Helena, and their two children, Hugo and Margarete; and Alfred Brum, the [[great-grandfather]] of Eckart.

Given a red stone by Dana, Eike follows the Homunculus' instructions to give the stone to Wagner. Time-traveling ten days later, Eike discovers that the result of Wagner's experiment destroyed the lab and caused Hugo, already upset by his mother's death due to a lingering illness, to build a time machine and track Eike down with the intent of killing him. Depending on the player's actions, Hugo holds either Margarete or Dana hostage in the present and plans to use the red stone, revealed to be the [[Philosopher's Stone]], to resurrect his mother.

===Endings===
''Shadow of Memories'' consists of eight endings, with six available at first. The last two must be unlocked by achieving the first six. The endings are presented in an alphabetical format, A–E, with B having two variations, and then two &quot;EX&quot; endings.  In all endings, he discovers that Homunculus was using him to ensure that he would be &quot;created&quot; (actually unsealed) by Wagner, and returns the digipad to him.

'''Ending A:''' Eike discovers that Homunculus switched the infants Dana and Margarete after meeting him in the towns park in 1980, making modern-day Dana actually Margarete Wagner and medieval-Margarete actually Dana. Furthermore, after visiting the fortuneteller in the modern day, it is revealed that she is the trapped disembodied spirit of Hugo's mother, Helena Wagner, brought back after a failed attempt by Hugo to resurrect her using unmastered alchemy. Homunculus creates a puppet resembling Wolfgang Wagner to attempt to dissuade Hugo from his plans, and after a short discussion, the puppet and Hugo disappear in a haze of smoke. Homunculus slyly reveals they could not call up the spirit of the real Dr. Wagner-as Eike had requested-because he was in fact not dead yet but Homunculus does not disclose Dr. Wagner's whereabouts.  While returning the digipad to Homunculus, Eike accidentally drops the device, which explodes, killing Homunculus with a single piece of shrapnel striking his cheek(Homunculus had stated on multiple occasions that their body was extremely fragile). Sometime later, it is mentioned that Margarete is now reunited with her biological parents, the Brums, who adopted her, though it appears that none of them are aware of their true relation to each other.  Depending on the outcome of a certain time-travelling sub-quest, Eckart's wife and Margarete's mother, Miriam Brum, may or may not be alive as well (she was implied to have been killed  by a seemingly stray bullet while taking a walk with her baby, in the original time-line). While on a date together in the townsquare, Eike and Margarete (who are implied to now be in a relationship) return to the spot where Homunculus died, only to discover a large full-grown tree which contains the Philosopher's Stone already embedded in its trunk.

'''Ending B:''' There are two variations to ending B: B1 and B2. In B1, Eike discovers the fortune teller's identity and convinces Hugo to enter the hut to meet with her; Helena causes the building to collapse, killing Hugo, who allows himself to be killed by debris in order to be reunited with his mother (though it is not mentioned if her spirit is actually freed by this).  He then returns Margarete to the past in which she grew up (though the present is actually her birth-era).  B2 sees Hugo attempt to abandon Margarete in the present, only to have Eckart subdue and scold him (neither he nor Margarete are aware of their true relation to each other). Hugo apologizes and returns to the past with Margarete. Both variations conclude with Eike's decision to have a drink at the bar in celebration of living.

'''Ending C:''' Eike travels to 1580. Hugo searches for his father's research while an elderly Hugo appears with a time machine and offers to teach him to use it. When Eike reveals his presence in an effort to stop young Hugo from listening, the older version panics and tries to escape up the stairs.  Margarete gets in his way, and he threatens and tries to strike her with his cane.  Hugo rushes to stop him, and the two make contact, causing both Hugos cease to exist due to a dimensional paradox.  Margarete collapses, and Eike returns to the present, where he gives the Digipad back.  After Homunculus' departure, Eike lies down in the street to look at the stars praising being alive, only to be run over by two drunk men in a car.

'''Ending D:''' Eike enters the ruined lab and burns Wagner's notes about the Stone, just as Hugo and Margarete enter. Unable to read the burned notes, Hugo apparently never learns about what his father was working on and thus never desires revenge or create a time machine, causing the Hugo and Margarete in the present to disappear.  Hugo then decides to live his own life.  It is revealed in a flashback that Homunculus is actually a djinn or genie imprisoned in the form of what became known as the Philosopher's Stone, and not at all an artificial life created by Wolfgang Wagner. Upon learning of this from a newly awakened Homunculus (who appears once the Stone evaporates into smoke), Wolfgang suddenly realizes that he has ultimately wasted the majority of his adult life for literally nothing as he has neglected his family by spending virtually all of his time over the years seeking to cure his wife's progressively degenerative illness by attempting to create a Philosopher's Stone in his lab, only for her to die anyway before he ever managed to accomplish anything; with Homunculus' revelation that the Philosopher's Stone is merely just the Homunculus' sealed form and not really an alchemical creation at all, it turns out that it was always impossible to begin with, already right from the very start. Instantly becoming extremely depressed, Wolfgang immediately experiences a nervous breakdown and fervently wishes to be young again like Eike (who he had met earlier and who impressed him with his youthful energy), so as to have a &quot;do-over&quot;.  Homunculus callously derides him for his spontaneous emotional outburst and an enraged Wolfgang then tries to reseal them with a pentagram.  This enrages Homunculus in turn and just before they transform into the Stone again, they curse Wolfgang &quot;to suffer the eternal night of youth&quot; (the blessing of eternal youth but saddled with perpetually recurring amnesia) thus filling the room with smoke and lightning.  Once the air clears, Wolfgang Wagner's younger self is revealed to in fact actually be Eike himself (it is subtly hinted earlier in the game in a conversation between Eike and Helena on her deathbed shortly before her death, that Helena finds that Eike's voice sounds shockingly similar to Wolfgang's).  Over the course of the next several centuries, Eike then becomes an immortal wanderer who permanently loses all his long-term memories on a regular periodic basis.

'''Ending E:''' Eike asks Dana, the actual Margarete Wagner (his biological daughter, based on Ending D, though neither is aware of this), to return with him to the present in which she grew up, and she agrees.  She is held hostage by Hugo (again, neither of them nor Eike are aware of their true relation to each other).  Eike goes to get Margarete and brings her to the present, where she slaps and scolds Hugo.  Tearfully, she tells him she can try and be more like their mother was to them and take care of them both.  Hugo apologizes, then returns to the past with Margarete, who had managed to warn Eike about Hugo's plans. Eike and Dana are then about to intimately share a tender embrace but are suddenly interrupted by Homunculus.  After a brief conversation in which Eike returns the digipad to Homunculus, Eike walks Dana back to her apartment.  It is shown that while Dana says to Eike that she feels that he seems like he would be a &quot;cool dad&quot; as he appears to her to be &quot;with it all&quot;, it remains deliberately ambiguous as to whether they still retain any serious romantic attraction for each other after literally years of separation between them on the part of Dana when she was in the Middle Ages; this has caused many fans to speculate that, given their continued flirtatious rapport with each other due to [[genetic sexual attraction]], could possibly lead to future [[accidental incest]] on their part as they are actually secretly long-lost father and daughter (further fueled by the ending screen featuring Dana's picture and containing an admission from Eike that he does not know what his future may hold, which may be for the best).  In a flashback, it is shown that Homunculus made Wagner disappear (possibly killing him), after he had wished never to see the creature again.  It is possible this is not actually a flashback, but an epilogue, revealing what happens after Eike gives Dr. Wagner the Stone, which contains the Homunculus he sealed away in another timeline.  This also explains how Eike is able to encounter Homunculus in the ruins of Wagner's house after the experiment fails and why they did not recognize him.

'''EX Ending:''' This has two variations. Awakening from his first death with all his memories, Eike gets the red stone from the diner before Dana comes looking for him.  
:In EX 1 he gives Dr. Wagner the Philosopher's Stone, which allows him to make an elixir and successfully heals Helena at last.
:In EX 2 Eike dies in the bar fire to enter Homunculus' dimension and throws the Philosopher's Stone at him, causing them to cease to exist as a result of coming into contact with themself. 
Both result in Eike fading away. Regardless of either choice, the final scene is the same. A young man who resembles Eike is walking through the streets in present-day and struck down like before. The object turns out to be a soccer ball that hit him, and the man returns the ball to a boy similar in appearance to Hugo.

==Development==
Developed by [[Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo]], a playable demo of ''Shadow of Memories'' debuted at the [[Tokyo Game Show]] in September 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/09/26/tgs-2000-hands-on-with-shadow-of-memories |title=TGS 2000: Hands-on with Shadow of Memories |date=September 25, 2000 |author=IGN staff |publisher=IGN |accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game went through several development titles: ''The Day and Night of [[Walpurgisnacht]]'', ''Days of Walpurgis'', and ''Time Adventure''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/konamis-tgs-software-lineup/1100-2541754/ |title=Konami's TGS Software Lineup |date=March 9, 2000 |author=Sato, Yukiyoshi Ike |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/days-of-walpurgis-renamed/1100-2580002/ |title=Days of Walpurgis Renamed |date=May 31, 2000 |author=Sato, Yushiyoki Ike |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Konami released ''Shadow of Memories'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] in Japan on February 22, 2001, in North America on March 5, 2001 (retitled as &quot;Shadow of Destiny&quot;), and in Europe on March 30, 2001.

Reviewers praised the overall plot of the PS2 version as the game's strength.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpot review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RPG Fan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Game Revolution&quot;/&gt; [[IGN]]'s David Zdyrko called the story &quot;one of the deepest and most engaging that has ever been told through a videogame.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN review&quot;/&gt; Andrew Vestal of [[GameSpot]] enjoyed the idea of the detective in a [[murder mystery]] as the intended victim.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpot review&quot;/&gt; Writing for [[Game Revolution]], Shawn Sanders liked the time-traveling aspect of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Game Revolution&quot;/&gt;

The graphics of the PS2 version received mixed responses. Sanders found the textures of the game &quot;clean and detailed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Game Revolution&quot;/&gt; Zdyrko disliked the low amount of detail on the characters and some of the background, but enjoyed the &quot;lighting and particle effects&quot;, particularly the snow and night.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN review&quot;/&gt; Vestal praised the different visual depictions of Lebensbaum, and felt that high level of detail in the backgrounds helped to somewhat counterbalance the low-resolution of the game's graphics.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpot review&quot;/&gt; Critics agreed that the [[full motion video]]s were well-done,&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RPG Fan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Game Revolution&quot;/&gt; and praised the realistic character animation.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpot review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RPG Fan&quot;/&gt; 
 
Critics commented on the general absence of action in the gameplay.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpot review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RPG Fan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Game Revolution&quot;/&gt; Sanders considered it the game's greatest flaw and a possible source of frustration for players.&lt;ref name=&quot;Game Revolution&quot;/&gt; The slow beginning to the PS2 version was remarked on by critics, who felt that the game eventually picked up after a while.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Game Revolution&quot;/&gt; Additionally, the &quot;stiff&quot; motion of the protagonist when running drew criticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpot review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN review&quot;/&gt; Reviewers noted the relatively short play time,&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpot review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN review&quot;/&gt; and felt that the multiple endings enhanced the game's replay value.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpot review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Game Revolution&quot;/&gt;

The game's soundtrack was well received. Critics wrote that it suited the mood&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpot review&quot;/&gt; and occasionally helped to build suspense.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RPG Fan&quot;/&gt; The voice acting also went over well, with several critics remarking on the quality of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RPG Fan&quot;/&gt; Zdyrko described it as &quot;first-class&quot; and believable, and commented that since much of the PS2 version consists of dialogue, flawed voice acting might have ruined the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN review&quot;/&gt; Vestal considered the voice acting of [[B-movie]] quality, but not flawed enough to be a major distraction.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpot review&quot;/&gt;

'''''Alfred Hitchcock Presents: The Final Cut''''' is a 2002 [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game, in the detective-mystery genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/alfred-hitchcock-presents-the-final-cut |title=Alfred Hitchcock Presents The Final Cut for Windows (2001) - MobyGames |work=MobyGames |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906060721/http://www.mobygames.com/game/alfred-hitchcock-presents-the-final-cut |archivedate=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''The Final Cut'' is a suspenseful adventure game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=x8wPAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Alfred+Hitchcock+Presents:+The+Final+Cut%22OR%22Hitchcock:+The+Final+Cut%22&amp;dq=%22Alfred+Hitchcock+Presents:+The+Final+Cut%22OR%22Hitchcock:+The+Final+Cut%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAGoVChMI3qWYlebxyAIVEjOICh2yzAW6|title=Software and CD-ROM Reviews on File|work=google.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; that focuses on item collecting and puzzle solving as the main mechanic.  However the game also bears some similarities to the survival horror actioner genre. The art design sees 3D characters be manipulated across a 2D environment. The game is interspersed with [[full motion video]]s (FMVs) to further the narrative.&lt;ref name=&quot;ivansulic&quot;/&gt; The controls are a combination of the keyboard and mouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;tap-repeatedly.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tap-repeatedly.com/Reviews/Hitchcock/Final_Cut.shtml |title=Four Fat Chicks -- Alfred Hitchcock Presents: The Final Cut Review |work=tap-repeatedly.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305131437/http://www.tap-repeatedly.com/Reviews/Hitchcock/Final_Cut.shtml |archivedate=2016-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The developer [[Arxel Tribe]] says the game can be completed in 20 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adventure-archiv.com/h/hitchcockreviewe.htm |title=Hitchcock - The Final Cut - Review english |author=slydos |work=adventure-archiv.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415194147/http://www.adventure-archiv.com/h/hitchcockreviewe.htm |archivedate=2015-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Robert Marvin-Jones is a billionaire recluse who decides to pay homage to Alfred Hitchcock by making a film in his backyard; however his film crew have gone missing and possibly been brutally murdered. Meanwhile, private detective Joseph Shamley has psychic power.
Jones' niece, a mute named Alicia, asks Shamley to use his powers of deduction to solve the mystery.&lt;ref name=&quot;ivansulic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2002/05/02/hitchcock-the-final-cut|title=Hitchcock: The Final Cut|author=Ivan Sulic|date=2 May 2002|work=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
According to ActionTrip, &quot;the developers bought the rights to use several famous scenes from [Hitchcock's] movies like ''Saboteur'', ''Psycho'' and ''Torn Curtain'' in the game&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;actiontrip.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actiontrip.com/reviews/hitchcock-the-final-cut.phtml |title=Hitchcock: The Final Cut Review |work=actiontrip.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906103249/http://www.actiontrip.com/reviews/hitchcock-the-final-cut.phtml |archivedate=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Film Remakes'' says the game contains &quot;extracts from six Hitchcock films (''Psycho'', ''Frenzy'', ''Torn Curtain'', ''Rope'', ''Saboteur'' and ''Shadow of a Doubt'')&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=-epMKoT-NO4C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=%22Alfred+Hitchcock+Presents:+The+Final+Cut%22OR%22Hitchcock:+The+Final+Cut%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAmoVChMI3qWYlebxyAIVEjOICh2yzAW6#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Alfred%20Hitchcock%20Presents%3A%20The%20Final%20Cut%22OR%22Hitchcock%3A%20The%20Final%20Cut%22&amp;f=false|title=Film Remakes|work=google.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Game Informer'' said that with games like ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents The Final Cut'', Ubisoft's PC catalog is an area where the company is able to experiment and take risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=BIlYAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Alfred+Hitchcock+Presents:+The+Final+Cut%22OR%22Hitchcock:+The+Final+Cut%22&amp;dq=%22Alfred+Hitchcock+Presents:+The+Final+Cut%22OR%22Hitchcock:+The+Final+Cut%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwA2oVChMI3qWYlebxyAIVEjOICh2yzAW6|title=Game Informer Magazine|work=google.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The game has received a mixed reception, and earned a [[Metacritic]] rating of 50% based on 17 critic reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/alfred-hitchcock-presents-the-final-cut |title=Alfred Hitchcock presents The Final Cut |work=Metacritic |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101031303/http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/alfred-hitchcock-presents-the-final-cut |archivedate=2015-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IGN wrote that the game offered &quot;no suspense, puzzles of little interest, poor dialog, a tortuous storyline, and awkward control&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2002/05/02/hitchcock-the-final-cut?page=2|title=Hitchcock: The Final Cut|date=2 May 2002|work=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; ActionTrip concluded that &quot;using Hitchcock's name and work was a good marketing move, but, unfortunately the game quality doesn't live up to it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;actiontrip.com&quot;/&gt; Quandary wrote &quot;Being an Arxel Tribe game, I was actually a bit disappointed in the figures.

&quot;'''How Some Children Played at Slaughtering'''&quot; (German: ''Wie Kinder Schlachtens miteinander gespielt haben'', also translated as &quot;How children played slaughtering together&quot;) is a set of two short and rather gruesome [[anecdote]]s from [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]]. It was removed from the book in the second edition, and is missing from most modern editions as well.

== Synopsis ==
; Part One
: In a city named Franecker, located in West Friesland, a group of young children (around 5 or 6 years of age) once played at being a butcher, a cook, a cook's assistant, etc., and killed the child who played as &quot;the pig&quot;. The child who played as &quot;the butcher&quot; was arrested and charged for murder, but the town council (which also functioned as a court), never having had such a case before it, was unsure whether to punish such a young child. An old, wise councilor finally came up with a special method to decide if the child was guilty or not. He brought a ripe, appetizing apple and a high-value gold coin, took one in each hand and let the child choose one of them. If &quot;the butcher&quot; chose the apple (presumably proving that the child still had a completely naive mind), then he was innocent, and would be free to go; if he chose the gold coin (presumably proving that a more abstract understanding of values had already developed in the child), the child was guilty, and would be hanged for murder. &quot;The butcher&quot; chose the apple without any hesitation. Therefore, he was released and all charges were dropped.

; Part Two
: One day, two brothers saw their father killing off a pig. They imitated what they saw and the older brother killed his younger brother. Their mother, who was giving the baby a bath, heard her child scream and abandoned the baby in the bath.  When she saw what her eldest child had done, she took the knife out of her younger son's throat, and in her rage stabbed her older son in the heart. When the mother found out that meanwhile the baby had drowned in the tub, she felt an inconsolable desperation and committed suicide by hanging herself. After a long day of work in the field, the father came home. Finding out that his whole family was dead, he soon also died from sadness.

The first recension is copied out of an old book in the Berliner Abendblättern von Kleist (1810. No. 39.). The second is found Martin Zeilers Miscell. Nürnberg 1661. P. 388. who took it from J. Wolf Lectiones Memorabiles. Laving. 1600. folio.

He is then informed by his long-dead wife, Julia, that he must solve the Bell Killer mystery so he can rejoin her.

''Murdered: Soul Suspect'' received an average reception upon release; most criticisms centered on the poor combat, short length, lack of replay value, and lack of difficulty. The game did however receive praise for some aspects of its story and its original concept.

In present-day [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], a [[serial killer]] known as the Bell Killer begins murdering seemingly unconnected victims. [[Detective|Police Detective]] Ronan O'Connor is able to track down the Bell Killer, but is thrown out of a window and shot to death during a fight. He returns in the form of a [[ghost]], and learns that in order to reach the [[afterlife]] and meet his wife Julia, he must first discover the identity of his killer. With the help of [[Abigail Williams (Salem witch trials)|Abigail]], the ghost of a [[Puritan]] child, Ronan is able to use his ghostly abilities to return to the fight scene, and discovers that a [[mediumship|medium]] named Joy witnessed the fight, and is now hiding in a church.

Joy is in search of her missing mother Cassandra, who was consulting with the police on the Bell Killer case, and initially refuses to help Ronan. He travels to the police station where she is being held, helping her escape so as she can help him interact with the physical world and track down his killer. While leading Joy out of the station, Ronan discovers that Baxter, a hostile fellow officer, was the one working with Cassandra. Cassandra's research leads the pair to the Salem graveyard to investigate a possible Bell Killer victim. After pursuing the ghost of the young drowned girl, Sophia, Ronan's ghostly powers allow him to view flashbacks of the murder. Sophia reveals that the Bell Killer asked her about a 'contract'.

A review of Cassandra's research leads the pair to a mental hospital to find the Bell Killer's surviving victim, Iris. Infiltrating the facility, they learn Iris possesses the same ability to see ghosts and realize the Bell Killer is killing [[Mediumship|psychic mediums]]. It is revealed that Iris is possessed by the spirit of her sister, Rose, whom the Bell Killer burned alive after she helped Iris escape. Rose, Iris, and Joy return to the church.  Meanwhile, Ronan investigates a museum exhibit about the [[Salem witch trials|Salem witch hunts]]. There, he deduces that the Bell Killer is executing his victims as if they are witches; psychic flashbacks reveal that Baxter suspiciously concealed evidence at the museum about the Bell Killer. Believing Baxter is the Bell Killer, Ronan leaves the museum and notices several police cars heading toward the church.

Once there, Ronan learns that the Bell Killer attacked the building, crushing Iris to death, and slaughtering several people who stood in his way. Although Joy is safe, she is re-arrested and taken away by Ronan's brother-in-law Rex, the lead detective on the Bell Killer case. Investigating the church, Ronan realizes that the Bell Killer is hiding in the derelict Judgment House. There, Ronan discovers evidence of the Bell Killer's activities and clues implying that the killings have been occurring for hundreds of years.

Ronan discovers Baxter's corpse. Baxter's ghost reveals he was murdered by the Bell Killer while secretly still investigating the case following his demotion.  He also clarifies that he'd been working with Cassandra and she's still alive. In the basement, flashbacks reveal that Abigail had been imprisoned there before she was hanged.  Her execution came as punishment for accusing several innocent people of witchcraft, resulting in their deaths. In anger, Abigail drew a bell symbol on the floor, swearing that she will never stop until the bell tolls for all of the witches in Salem.  She believed they made a contract with demons to gain inhuman powers.

Following the evidence, Ronan returns to the museum to discover that Rex is the Bell Killer, having been possessed by Abigail. As he prepares to hang Joy, Ronan manages to force Abigail's spirit out of Rex, and the pair battle by inflicting painful memories on each other.  These memories reveal that Abigail has possessed many people to carry out the Bell Killer murders before killing the possessed themselves. Among the possessed are Baxter, who she used to kill Rose, and Ronan, who killed Sophia.

Abigail summons a portal of demons to swallow Ronan.  He escapes its pull and forces Abigail in.  She submerges and the portal fades.

Joy is saved and later reunites with her mother.  Rex remains unaware of the crimes committed using his body. In the aftermath, Ronan hears Julia calling him and turns toward her voice.

The game came about because Square-Enix wished to appeal more towards the Western market. Yosuke Shiokawa, a creative director at Square-Enix, came up with the idea of a game where the player was a ghost and pitched it to the development team at Airtight Games.&lt;ref name=Venturebeat&gt;{{cite web|last=Takahashi|first=Dean|date=Feb 28, 2013|title=Murdered: Soul Suspect creative director shows how to design a new type of mystery game (interview) |work=Venturbeat|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/02/28/murdered-soul-suspect-creative-director-shows-how-to-design-a-new-type-of-mystery-game-interview/|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Airtight then came up with various concepts surrounding the ghost idea, some of which &quot;were almost [[superhero]] stories&quot; according to Matt Brunner, Airtight's Chief Creative Officer.&lt;ref name=Venturebeat/&gt; In an interview with [[IGN]],Shiokawa noted that he was inspired from watching the movie ''[[Die Hard]]'' and asking himself &quot;what if John McClane died? What if John McClane was killed? Is he going to give up?&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Diehard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shea|first1=Cam|title=THE SURPRISING INSPIRATIONS FOR MURDERED: SOUL SUSPECT|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/04/the-surprising-inspirations-for-murdered-soul-suspect|website=IGN|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;He reasoned that he wouldn't and that &quot;even as a ghost he’s going to try and save the people in Nakatomi Plaza, including his wife.'’ which led to the initial concept of the game. &lt;ref name=&quot;Diehard&quot;/&gt;

The team had trouble at first integrating Western and Eastern philosophies regarding ghosts.&lt;ref name=Venturebeat/&gt; About the process, Brunner later stated &quot;There are a lot of assumptions that we weren’t even aware of, that we were making on both sides, about how to fictionally support who you are as a character in this world. It took us, I would say, a good year and a half of constant back-and-forth to get that sense of, “What, really? Oh&quot;, so that’s what you’re talking about.”&lt;ref name=Venturebeat/&gt;

''Murdered: Soul Suspect'' received an average reception upon release; most criticisms centered around the poor combat, short length, lack of replay value, and lack of difficulty. Aggregating review websites [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]] gave the PlayStation 4 version 61.29% based on 41 reviews and 59/100 based on 60 reviews,&lt;ref name=&quot;GRPS4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MCPS4&quot;/&gt; the Microsoft Windows version 58.00% based on 12 reviews and 59/100 based on 22 reviews&lt;ref name=&quot;GRPC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MCPC&quot;/&gt; and the Xbox One version 55.76% based on 17 reviews and 50/100 based on 16 reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;GRXONE&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MCXONE&quot;/&gt;

[[IGN]]'s Lucy O'Brien gave the game a 5.5 out of 10 calling it &quot;Mediocre&quot; and saying: &quot;There are some great concepts in ''Murdered: Soul Suspect'', but they feel undercooked or underutilised, and the lack of demand for any real input from us makes ''Murdered'' feel like a pick-a-path game where there’s only one path. It scrapes by on the power of its central whodunnit mystery, but I can’t help but feel that ''Murdered: Soul Suspect'' is ten hours worth of unfinished business.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN rev&quot;/&gt;

[[GameSpot]]'s Tom McShea was slightly less negative in giving the game a 6 out of 10; he praised certain aspects of the story saying: &quot;Despite [the] issues, at no point was I disenchanted by ''Soul Suspect''. Even though I recognized how ludicrous the game often was, I was still invested in the story that was slowly unfolding.&quot; McShea wrapped up the review by saying: &quot;''Murdered: Soul Suspect'' has a lot more spirit than its taciturn protagonist could ever muster.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GS review&quot;&gt;Tom McShea. (June 5, 2014). [http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/murdered-soul-suspect-review/1900-6415781/ Murdered: Soul Suspect review] ''[[GameSpot]]'' Retrieved April 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Reiner of [[Game Informer]] gave the game a 6.5 out of 10; he summed up his review by saying &quot;This is one of those games that I find myself raving about one second, and dragging through the mud the next. Is it worth your time? I think so. Despite its numerous shortcomings, I was entertained to the point of not wanting to put it down. It’s a satisfying murder mystery and a sub-par game all rolled in one. The story won out in the end for me. If you can tolerate the shoddy investigation gameplay, there’s plenty of fun (and wrong guessing) to be had.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GI rev&quot;/&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Galileo'''''|ガリレオ|Garireo}} is a [[Japanese television drama]] based on {{Nihongo|''Detective Galileo''|探偵ガリレオ|Tantei Garireo}}, a novel by mystery writer {{Nihongo|[[Keigo Higashino]]|東野 圭吾|Higashino Keigo}}. It narrates the events and cases encountered by Kaoru Utsumi, a rookie detective, and Manabu Yukawa, a university associate professor, as the two pair up to solve many mysterious cases. ''Galileo SP'' was aired on October 4, 2008 on the same day as the release of the film [[Suspect X|The Devotion of Suspect X]].

A second series began airing on Fuji TV on April 15, 2013 and ended with an adaption of the novel [[Salvation of a Saint]]. The second movie, titled {{Nihongo|''[[Midsummer's Equation]]''|真夏の方程式|Manatsu no hōteishiki|lit. The Equation of Midsummer}}, premiered in both Japan and Hong Kong on June 29, 2013.

==Premise==
Kaoru Utsumi, a rookie detective who has just been reassigned to the criminal division, finds the investigation of her first murder case stalled by seemingly-[[supernatural]] phenomena surrounding the event. She seeks help from Shunpei Kusanagi, a senior detective at the police headquarter famous as a &quot;Mystery Hunter&quot;. Kusanagi, however, reveals to Utsumi that he was only able to solve the cases thanks to his college friend, Teito University professor Manabu Yukawa. Yukawa is a tall, handsome, brilliant but eccentric scientist who is interested in nothing but physics, while Utsumi is a hot-blooded detective with a strong sense of justice. Together, the odd pair solves many difficult and seemingly impossible events with their individual talents.

'''''Vampyr''''' is an upcoming [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]] developed by [[Dontnod Entertainment]] and published by [[Focus Home Interactive]] for release on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on 5 June 2018.

The plot relates how Jonathan Reid, a doctor who has turned into a [[vampire]], comes to terms with his [[undead]] condition as he is torn between the [[Hippocratic Oath#&quot;First do no harm&quot;|Hippocratic Oath]] and his newfound bloodthirsty nature. The player is under no obligation to kill to finish the game. [[Dialog tree|Dialogue option]]s can be used for hunting prey to feed on, which replenishes strength and [[Experience point#Level-based progression|levels up]] the lead character. Weapons and supernatural abilities are employed while combatting enemies. [[London]] serves as a fictionalised semi-[[open world]] composed of four districts, which can all be destroyed based on the player's actions.
 
''Vampyr'' takes place in London during the [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 Spanish flu pandemic]], whose setting was researched by travelling there, consulting history books and documentaries. The visuals were made with fictional and factual reference points in mind. [[Olivier Deriviere]] composed the original score.

==Gameplay==
''Vampyr'' is an [[action role-playing game]] played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]].&lt;ref name=&quot;third person&quot; /&gt; The player controls the game's protagonist Jonathan E. Reid,&lt;ref name=&quot;E&quot; /&gt; a doctor who was made into a [[vampire]], and whose thirst for blood compels him to kill innocent people. To do this successfully, he must gather information about his targets—study and change their habits, collect clues, and maintain certain relationships by [[Dialog tree|communicating]] with the sixty inhabitants of [[London]],&lt;ref name=&quot;information&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;more&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thirlwell-Feb2018&quot; /&gt; which serves as a fictionalised semi-[[open world]] built around hubs of seamless neighbourhoods tethered to other interlinking areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;boss&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;semi&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mesmerise&quot; /&gt; It is possible to finish the game without taking a life,&lt;ref name=&quot;third person&quot; /&gt; which best preserves the character's cover as a doctor&lt;ref name=&quot;cover&quot; /&gt; but leaves him nearly incapable of [[Experience point#Level-based progression|levelling up]].&lt;ref name=&quot;writer&quot; /&gt; Killing no one unlocks one of four different endings.&lt;ref name=&quot;unlock&quot; /&gt; There is a [[skill tree]] that facilitates improvement of abilities, which is fuelled by [[experience point]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;skill tree&quot; /&gt; gained from blood and, alternatively, investigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;blood investigation&quot; /&gt; The branches of the skill tree concern shadow, instinct, and social abilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;boss&quot; /&gt;

If one so chooses, anyone in the game could be targeted, which will have consequences that affect the citizens of London.&lt;ref name=&quot;information&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;america&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;londizens&quot; /&gt; Reid can turn people into vampires&lt;ref name=&quot;if eaten&quot; /&gt; and will only be able to enter a house with an invitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;lore&quot; /&gt; Locals each have their different backgrounds, relationships and daily routines. If killed, they will impart to Reid their last thought.&lt;ref name=&quot;impart&quot; /&gt; The &quot;Mesmerise&quot; ability can determine the behaviour of weaker targets, like coercing them into revealing important information&lt;ref name=&quot;coercing&quot; /&gt; or guiding them to less conspicuous areas so as to feed without resorting to combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;mesmerise&quot; /&gt; Feeding on human blood will unlock new vampiric powers in addition to providing nourishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;E&quot; /&gt; With crafted medicine, Reid can heal injured or sick victims, whom if eaten,&lt;ref name=&quot;boss&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;if eaten&quot; /&gt; will yield more experience points in the process;&lt;ref name=&quot;more&quot; /&gt; the rate of their affliction can be viewed using Reid's vampire senses.&lt;ref name=&quot;affliction&quot; /&gt; His senses will also detect blood.&lt;ref name=&quot;w4yp01nt&quot; /&gt; Each of the four districts will have a score based on the average health of its citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;districts&quot; /&gt; Reid navigates the city of London using a [[waypoint]] with icons leading to a given destination.&lt;ref name=&quot;w4yp01nt&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Vampyr gameplay.gif|thumb|right|220px|Reid using &quot;Spring&quot; to reach lower ground and defeat his enemies]]

Reid can wield improvised [[melee weapon]]s, such as a saw, as well as [[ranged weapon]]s including the [[Webley Revolver]].&lt;ref name=&quot;information&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;webley&quot; /&gt; Being able to use three-hit [[Combo (video gaming)|combos]], dodge rolls, and [[Parry (fencing)|parrying]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Thirlwell-Feb2018&quot; /&gt; he can fight against other vampires like him{{mdash}}[[aristocrat]]s who go by the name of Ekon; sewer-dwelling vampires known as Skals; the Vulkod{{mdash}}a stronger breed of vampire resembling [[werewolves]]; Nemrod{{mdash}}vampires who hunt their own kind;&lt;ref name=&quot;ekon&quot; /&gt; and the Guard of Priwen{{mdash}}a secret society of [[Vampire hunter|vampire slayers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;turned to&quot; /&gt; [[Boss (video gaming)|Boss]]es are also featured.&lt;ref name=&quot;boss&quot; /&gt; Reid is adaptable to other vampire features, like the claws of a Vulkod.&lt;ref name=&quot;ekon&quot; /&gt; Weapon improvement through crafting is made possible by looting items from the bodies of victims. While using vampiric powers in combat, the character's blood bar drains. This forces him to feed so he can immediately replenish his strength.&lt;ref name=&quot;E&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;w4yp01nt&quot; /&gt; With the vitality attained from killing a human being, he can boil the blood of his enemies, cast blood spears,&lt;ref name=&quot;viable&quot; /&gt; throw mist [[bomb]]s, and turn invisible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thirlwell-Feb2018&quot; /&gt; Reid uses his control of shadows to hide himself and strike at his opponents.&lt;ref name=&quot;ekon&quot; /&gt; He can use &quot;Spring&quot; to scale locations otherwise out of reach and charge more rapidly across gaps,&lt;ref name=&quot;third person&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mesmerise&quot; /&gt; which once upgraded can do damage on impact and grant temporary invincibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;spring&quot; /&gt; Rushing forward at unusual momentum may be deployed to avoid combat altogether.&lt;ref name=&quot;altogether&quot; /&gt;

==Development==
Development of ''Vampyr'' began with a team of 60 people—later expanded to around 80—many of whom worked on [[Dontnod Entertainment]]'s previous project ''[[Life Is Strange]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;more&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eighty&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MCV-Nov2017&quot; /&gt; For a short time, the developer considered to set the game in [[United States in the 1950s|1950s America]],&lt;ref name=&quot;america&quot; /&gt; but after narrative director Stéphane Beauverger joined the project,&lt;ref name=&quot;MCV-Nov2017&quot; /&gt; it was discarded to inspire a more [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] mood with focus on the [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 Spanish flu pandemic]], set in London. The paintings of [[Phil Hale]] influenced the art style, also for the purpose of atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;tentative 17&quot; /&gt;

Dontnod conducted field research on the setting by visiting London and taking photographs,&lt;ref name=&quot;more&quot; /&gt; but since the city had been largely rebuilt, history books and documentaries concerning [[Whitechapel]], the [[London Docks]], and the [[Isle of Dogs]] were also consulted.&lt;ref name=&quot;viable&quot; /&gt; Literary sources included ''Liquid History: The Thames Through Time'' and ''The Book Of Facial Expressions: Babies To Teens'',&lt;ref name=&quot;3dg3&quot; /&gt; while the television series ''[[Casualty 1900s]]'' and ''[[The Knick]]'' were turned to for medical information.&lt;ref name=&quot;turned to&quot; /&gt; Events surrounding the period were studied using both factual and fictional reference points{{efn|As such, the game world has been described as a [[uchronia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;turned to&quot; /&gt;}} to create the visuals, realised with [[Photorealism|photorealistic]] [[High-dynamic-range rendering|lighting]],&lt;ref name=&quot;photorealistic&quot; /&gt; and [[Image editing|post-processes]] running on the [[Unreal Engine#Unreal Engine 4|Unreal Engine 4]].&lt;ref name=&quot;information&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tentative 17&quot; /&gt; [[Motion capture]] was used to track character movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Connor-Feb2018&quot; /&gt;

The killing of innocents in the game as the price for [[immortality]] explores the dualism of the protagonist's survival as a vampire and a doctor, either by adhering to the [[Hippocratic Oath#&quot;First do no harm&quot;|Hippocratic Oath]] or capitulating to the vampiric nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;tentative 17&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oath&quot; /&gt; In August 2016, the major obstacles in developing the game on [[Xbox One]] had been overcome with the assurance that there would be no downgrades despite its hardware disadvantages.&lt;ref name=&quot;hardware&quot; /&gt; [[Olivier Deriviere]] served as the composer, infusing the score with [[industrial music]] to portray the solitude and inner struggle of the main character. Eric-Maria Couturier played the [[cello]], whose sounds were intended to go from &quot;emotional&quot; to &quot;bestial&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prell-Jan2018&quot; /&gt;

==Release==
After a technical issue delayed it from its original November 2017 launch date, ''Vampyr'' was rescheduled to be released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and Xbox One in Q1/Q2 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;Romano-2017&quot; /&gt; Those who pre-order the game will gain access to bonus [[downloadable content]] (DLC) called &quot;The Hunters Heirlooms&quot;, which contains an exclusive sword, pistol, and outfit.&lt;ref name=&quot;hunters heirlooms&quot; /&gt; Focus Home Interactive will consider ''Vampyr'' successful if one million copies are sold, but said that selling half would nevertheless be profitable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dealessandri-Nov2017&quot; /&gt; A four-episode [[making-of]] video series was released starting in January 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood-Jan2018&quot; /&gt; The fourth episode in the series revealed that ''Vampyr'' would be released on 5 June 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Connor-Feb2018&quot; /&gt;

==Awards==
Following its appearance at [[E3 2017]], ''Vampyr'' received one of [[GamesRadar]]'s Best of E3 awards&lt;ref name=&quot;e32017&quot; /&gt; and was nominated for [[GamesBeat]]'s Unreal Underdog award&lt;ref name=&quot;bestofu&quot; /&gt; and [[Game Critics Awards]]' Best RPG award.&lt;ref name=&quot;bestofgca&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gc4w&quot; /&gt;

'''''Queen of Angels''''' is a 1990 [[science fiction]] novel written by [[Greg Bear]]. It was nominated for the [[Hugo Award|Hugo]], [[John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel|Campbell]] and [[Locus Award|Locus]] Awards in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWE-1991&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by a sequel, &quot;/&quot;, also known as ''Slant''.

== Plot summary ==

''Queen of Angels'' describes our world just prior to the binary millennium (2048 AD) through several parallel (and to some degree interlocking) tales. [[Nanotechnology]] has transformed almost every aspect of American society, and its application to [[psychology]], [[psychiatry]], and [[neuroscience]] has resulted in new techniques for mental &quot;therapy&quot; that have created new forms of social stratification. Increasingly, individuals are &quot;therapied&quot; - that is, by means of &quot;nano-therapy&quot;, they are turned into well-integrated personalities capable of productive work and constructive social interaction which does not threaten the social order. Therapied individuals have access to the best jobs. There are two other classes: the &quot;high naturals&quot;, who possess such a positive mental makeup that they don't need any therapy, and the &quot;untherapied&quot;, who find themselves increasingly marginalized.

The central unifying element involves a famous writer, Emmanuel Goldsmith, who has committed a gruesome series of murders, a crime almost unheard of in the age of therapy. One storyline involves Mary Choy, a high natural police detective assigned to the case to track down and arrest the murderer. Mary is a transform - she has chosen to have her body extensively altered by nanotechnology, both to enhance her abilities as a policewoman and for aesthetic reasons.

A second storyline involves Richard Fettle, a good friend of the murderer, also an untherapied writer, who must come to terms with what happened to his friend and how his life—and that of artists, and all of the untherapied—must change. The third plot line concerns Martin Burke, a pioneer in psychotherapy who uses a technique which allows him to directly enter and interact with a patient's psychology - the &quot;Country of the Mind&quot; - through a sort of virtual reality. Although in a position of disgrace at the story's opening, Dr. Burke is given the opportunity to use his technique to explore Goldsmith's mind, which turns out to be one of the most fascinating and dangerous minds imaginable.

Finally, the fourth plotline considers the nature of [[artificial intelligence]], as an AI robot [[space probe]] discovers life on a planet in the [[Alpha Centauri]] system, and simultaneously achieves its own independent self-awareness, as does its twin back on Earth.

The novel deals with issues of [[technology]], [[identity (social science)|identity]], the nature of [[justice]], and the existence of [[consciousness]] and the [[soul]].  ''Queen of Angels'', set in 2047, was written just before the creation of the first website in 1991 and describes a global network based on the exchange of text (a sort of super [[USENET]]), whereas the sequel, ''Slant'', set in 2055 and written in 1997 after the coming of the [[World Wide Web]], describes a global network which has inexplicably changed to resemble a vast shared [[virtual reality]].

Also in the novel is &quot;Citizen Oversight&quot;—a quasi-governmental agency that collects data on citizens: medical, financial, legal. It also collects information from public sources such as video cameras with facial recognition and has the ability to track individuals. Local police agencies can appeal to Citizen Oversight to conduct a query on an individual and Citizen Oversight may or may not give out the requested information based on their interpretation of the &quot;Raphkind Amendment&quot;.

'''''Uncle John''''' is a 2015 American film directed by Steven Piet, who co-wrote it with producer Erik Crary.  It stars [[John Ashton (actor)|John Ashton]] in the title role as a respected and well-liked townsperson who murders a local bully.  John must deal with a spontaneous visit by his nephew ([[Alex Moffat (comedian)|Alex Moffat]]), who has brought along his love interest (Jenna Lyng), and the suspicions of the murdered man's brother ([[Ronnie Gene Blevins]]).  The story blends elements of [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], [[romantic comedy]], and [[crime drama]] films.  The film premiered at [[SXSW]] on March 16, 2015, and received a limited release from [[Filmbuff]] on September 18, 2015.

== Plot ==
John, a respected and well-liked carpenter in his small Wisconsin town, murders local town bully Dutch Miller.  While disposing of the body in a bonfire, John accepts help from a friend, who becomes concerned when he notices traces of blood on John's clothes.  John explains that he must have scratched himself while gathering wood.  When he is alone, he sifts through the ashes to smash pieces of tooth and bone that remain.

In Chicago, John's nephew Ben becomes infatuated with a new coworker, Kate, at an advertising agency.  After becoming friends, they meet for drinks at a bar.  Ben describes how his uncle raised him after his mother died and father abandoned him.  Although disappointed that Kate has a rule against dating co-workers, Ben accepts her help in setting up a one-night-stand at a bar.  When she asks him to reciprocate the next day, they discuss what they look for in sexual partners.  Kate says she likes strong men who are good with their hands, and Ben tells her that his uncle is a carpenter.  Ben tries to kiss her, but she reminds him of her rule against dating coworkers; he awkwardly apologizes the next day.

As Kate and Ben grow closer, John and his friends gossip together about the town's inhabitants.  Dutch is revealed to have become a born-again Christian, and as penance for his prior troublemaking, has been confessing to various people and apologizing.  When his friends ask John whether Dutch had come to him about his sister, John says he has not seen Dutch in years.  Dutch's brother, Danny, is also rumored to suspect his brother of having been murdered.  John later runs into Danny near where Dutch's abandoned truck was found, and Danny says he has been taking note of all people who pass by for the past few days, on the belief that the killer will return to the scene of the crime.  The sheriff stops by John's house to warn him that Danny has grown suspicious of several people, including John.

While discussing their favorite restaurants, Kate suggests a spontaneous road trip to visit Ben's hometown.  There, they visit John, and all meet up with Danny.  Danny storms off after John denies meeting with Dutch and refuses to discuss what happened between Dutch and John's sister, who apparently committed suicide when Dutch broke off their affair.  That night, Ben and Kate admit their attraction to each other and make out, while John kills Danny, who has come onto his property with a pistol, gasoline, and lighter.  While driving back, Kate describes her family, who she says are all crazy because of their quirks; Ben says that his uncle is normal.  As John burns Danny's corpse in a bonfire, the sheriff comes by to warn him about Danny, who has gone missing but left behind a pistol in his car.

They contacted Ashton and Blevins directly, and Lyng was cast after auditioning through Skype.

== Plot ==

For their vacation, [[Ash Williams|Ash]], his wife [[List of The Evil Dead characters#Linda|Linda]], their friend [[List of The Evil Dead characters#Scotty|Scotty]], and his wife [[List of The Evil Dead characters#Shelly|Shelly]] travel to an apparently abandoned woodland cabin, where they find a recorder, audio reels, and an old book. Scotty plays one of the reels, which were made by the cabin's owners, [[List of The Evil Dead characters#Professor Raymond Knowby|Professor Raymond Knowby]], and his wife, [[List of The Evil Dead characters#Henrietta Knowby|Henrietta]]. The reel reveals that the professor and his wife were working on translating the book, a seemingly demonic sex guide known as the ''[[Necronomicon|Necronomicum]] Ex-Mortis''. While reciting [[Klaatu barada nikto|a mantra]] that he found in the ''Necronomicum'', Knowby seemingly went insane, laughing maniacally as he repeated the words over and over again, awakening an evil force.

The group ignores the reel, and while Shelly goes to lie down, Ash, Linda, and Scotty have a [[threesome]] in a bedroom. Shelly walks in on the trio and, distraught over Scotty's infidelity, runs out into the forest, where she is violated by possessed trees that turn her into a &quot;Deadite&quot;. Shelly returns to the cabin, knocks Ash out, and stabs Linda with a piece of bark that she pulls out of her vagina, infecting the other woman with the evil. Shelly proceeds to seduce Scotty, have sex with him, and rip his throat and testicles out.

When Shelly tries to attack Linda, Ash fends her off with a fireplace poker, and locks her in the cellar, but she escapes, and begins having sex with the now demonic Linda. Aroused by the sight of the two Deadites going at it, Ash tries fingering Shelly, which results in his hand becoming possessed. Ash is forced to cut his hand off with a chainsaw, which he then uses to kill Shelly by forcing her to &quot;ride&quot; the tool's blade.

Linda, who has returned to normal, confronts Ash with a locket identical to the one that he had earlier given her. Inside the locket is a picture of Ash having sex with another woman, which angers Linda to the point of causing her to turn back into a Deadite. Ash and Linda wind up having sex; afterward, Ash beheads Linda with the chainsaw, and takes her body out into the woods to dispose of it. Linda's still-living severed head taunts Ash, annoying him into masturbating onto it out of spite.

Ash returns to the cabin, and goes into hysterics when the furniture and fixtures (including a mounted deer head) go haywire. Outside, Linda (who has reattached her head) rises from the grave, along with Deadite versions of two of Ash's ex-girlfriends. Ash tries to kill the Deadites with the chainsaw (which he has replaced his missing hand with) but it will not start, leaving him unable to fight off the demonesses as they force him into an [[orgy]]. The reverse gangbang ends with Ash using the now functional chainsaw to dismember the undead women as he quips, &quot;Groovy!&quot;

== Reception ==

[[Ain't It Cool News]] responded positively to the film, noting that it was &quot;a humorous [[Homage (arts)|homage]]&quot; and that &quot;the story bits, what little there are, are pretty entertaining&quot; before concluding, &quot;Sure, there will be those who will turn their noses up to ''Evil Head'', but in this wide world of horror, surely there is room for the porn horror subgenre; especially in this case when it apes the original so well&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Aint&quot;/&gt; Peter Warren of ''[[AVN (magazine)|AVN]]'' gave ''Evil Head'' a perfect score of 5, finding it to be &quot;every bit the rollicking rollercoaster ride of gleeful [[grotesque]]ry one could hope for&quot; and &quot;without question one of the most outstanding productions to ever come out of Burning Angel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.avn.com/movies/118227.html|title = ''Evil Head''|last = Warren|first = Peter|publisher = ''Adult Video News''|date = 5 April 2013|website = avn.com|accessdate = 18 February 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger T. Pipe]], who awarded the film an 8/12, stated ''Evil Head'' was &quot;funny, well shot and sexy as fuck&quot;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.rogreviews.com/35148/evil-head/|title = ''Evil Head''|last = Pipe|first = Roger|publisher = Rog Reviews|date = 6 September 2013|website = rogreviews.com|accessdate = 18 February 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt; while Don Houston of XCritic categorized it as &quot;highly recommended&quot; after deeming it &quot;remarkably entertaining as a porno horror hybrid fuck flick&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.xcritic.com/review/39073/joanna-angel-evil-head/|title = ''Evil Head''|last = Houston|first = Don|publisher = XCritic|date = 16 November 2012|website = xcritic.com|accessdate = 18 February 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;

A grade of 3/5 was given to ''Evil Head'' by Inked Angels, which opined, &quot;The sex parts are just mediocre.

'''''Murder Collection V.1''''' is a 2009 American horror [[anthology film]] written and directed by [[Fred Vogel]], and co-written by Don Moore, Shelby Vogel, and Jerami Cruise.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|author = Steve Jones|title = Torture Porn: Popular Horror after Saw|url = http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9780230319417|accessdate = 25 February 2016|year = 2013|publisher = [[Palgrave Macmillan]]|isbn = 9781137317124|page = 174}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|author = Alexandra Heller-Nicholas|title = Found Footage Horror Films: Fear and the Appearance of Reality|url = http://www.mcfarlandbooks.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-7077-8|accessdate = 25 February 2016|year = 2014|publisher = [[McFarland &amp; Company]]|isbn = 9780786470778|page = 194}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The film's opening explains that in 1994 a [[web series]] called ''Murder'', which broadcast footage of actual deaths and acts of violence, appeared. After being active for four months, ''Murder'' was shut down by the authorities and had all of its content confiscated, though the website's host, a man known only as Balan, evaded capture. Now, years later, Balan has reemerged to share more clips that he has unearthed, while also offering commentary on people's obsession with death, the effect it has on them, and how accessible [[new media]] has made it. The series of videos is kicked off by Balan querying, &quot;I ask you all... Why are you watching? Are you trying to find reality? Do you feel the need to be shocked? To witness something that human eyes shouldn't see? Murder is reality. Death comes when you least expect it. With what you are about to observe, you may question your own integrity. You will ask, could this happen to me? My answer to you is... Yes it can.&quot;

* '''Bludgeoning:''' A drunk Russian man accidentally beats his teenage son to death in front of the son's [[webcam]].
* '''The Heist:''' A restaurant's security system records a robbery committed by four gunmen, who shoot a cashier in the head and a fleeing customer in the back.
* '''The Cheat:''' In front of a stationary camera a man reminisces about how he met his wife, and about all of the good times that they shared, while a monitor in the background shows his wife having sex with someone else. The man leaves the room, and the monitor shows him barging in on his wife and her lover, hacking the former to death with an ax before cutting out her heart, which the wife had once said would always belong to him.
* '''S&amp;G:''' A parking lot security camera catches two people attacking a couple, beating the man with a baseball bat, and abducting the woman.
* '''Broadway Rob:''' The distorted home movie of a pedophile who forces two gagged boys clad in only their socks and underwear to dance with him. One of the boys overpowers the pedophile, fatally strangling and stabbing him.
* '''Execution:''' A muffled black and white [[camcorder]] video of a hooded and masked group (possibly a [[cult]] or a gang) executing a man via decapitation in front of a woman, who they taunt with the severed head before shooting her.
* '''ATM:''' A man is mugged and killed at an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]].
* '''Autopsy:''' Japanese autopsy footage of a woman who was shot in the mouth, with the bullet exiting the top of her skull. The coroner eventually kicks the cameraman out due to his unprofessional antics and inattentiveness.
* '''Bullied:''' A trio of drunks use a camcorder to record themselves taking a man out into the woods under the pretense of initiating him into their group. The three bully and humiliate the man and, during a scuffle, one of them accidentally knocks him onto the knife another was holding. The trio panic and bicker, and the camera is dropped when a fight breaks out over whether they should go for help.
* '''Homecoming:''' A building security camera records two figures [[Garrote|garroting]] a man.
* '''Ransom:''' A deteriorated series of [[ransom]] videos depict three men brutalizing a [[Senate|senator's]] daughter, who eventually dies due to the severity of her injuries.

After the last clip, Balan delivers the closing statement, &quot;You realize now it's everywhere. Death casts a shadow on all our faces. The new media shines light on dank crevasses, revealing moral decay and broken experiences that are better left beyond the pale. Goosebumps explode on my skin with every clip we watch. I feel it now more than ever. How do you feel?&quot;

== Reception ==
Ryan Doom of [[JoBlo.com|Arrow in the Head]] gave ''Murder Collection V.1'' a 2/4 and wrote, &quot;In the end, I think it's an interesting exercise, but I don't know if it makes it a good movie. This isn't the type of film that I suspect most viewers would revisit often, if at all. Instead, it's just an experiment that people will dig or not, depending on how much violence and gore they can stomach without a story for context. While it captivated me at times with certain segments, others seemed unnecessary or overdone. But maybe that's just me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/dvd-reviews/murder-collection-v1|title = ''Murder Collection V.1''|last = Doom|first = Ryan|publisher = Arrow in the Head|date = |website = joblo.com|accessdate = 25 February 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt; Horror News's Jay Alan praised the special effects, also calling the acting &quot;convincingly believable for the most part&quot; and writing, &quot;As much as the film focuses on the graphic and dark nature of death, it also delves into the human psyche and personalities of the characters within the little given time shown.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://horrornews.net/30431/film-review-murder-collection-vol-1-2009/|title = Film Review: ''Murder Collection Vol. 1'' (2009)|last = Alan|first = Jay|publisher = Horror News|date = 2 November 2011|website = horrornews.net|accessdate = 25 February 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller''''' is a 4-part [[episodic video game|episodic]] [[point-and-click]] [[graphic adventure game]] released by [[Phoenix Online Studios]] for multiple platforms.  Funded through [[Kickstarter]] in 2011, four episodes were released on the [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[Macintosh|Mac]], with the first two on the [[iPad]].  [[Jane Jensen]], creator of the [[Sierra On-Line]] [[Gabriel Knight]] series, was a story consultant for the development of the game.

The first episode, ''The Hangman'', was released on October 30, 2012 and the final episode, ''The Cain Killer'', was released on September 19, 2013.

==Plot==
The story of ''Cognition'' revolves around Boston FBI agent Erica Reed, who has the unusual ability of [[postcognition]], the ability to see into the past of any object that she touches.  At first this power can’t be controlled, but, after training with an antique shop owner named Rose, Erica is not only able to control her power, but use it in different ways.  From seeing brief glimpses of the past on an object to helping someone regain lost memories to combining objects to see a vision of a scene where they were together, each ability is useful to help solve each murder mystery. The only person who knows her secret is her partner, John McCoy.

Each episode focuses on a different serial killer and covers a contained story arc while continuing the overarching story of the entire game: Erica’s search for the Cain Killer, who murdered her brother Scott but was never caught. After losing her brother three years previous to the start of the game, Erica is determined to track down his killer to the point of obsession.  She gets taken off the case by her boss, and is moved onto others under their jurisdiction.  But as the game progresses, it becomes clear that these seemingly unrelated killings all have clues that only Erica can find, meaning that someone else knows her secret and wants something from her—someone who has a grudge with the FBI. As Erica gets closer to the truth, with people around her dying and being hurt, she also gets closer to her goal of finding the Cain Killer. But she must make her choice between justice and revenge when the moment comes.

==Episodes==
Each episode provides around 3–6 hours of gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tech-gaming.com/cognition-episode-4/ Cognition Episode 4: The Cain Killer Review] by Tech-Gaming&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Episode One: The Hangman'' (October 30, 2012) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postudios.com/blog/?p=2139 Episode 1 Release Announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;===
It is three years after the death of Scott Reed, FBI agent Erica Reed’s brother, and she is still on the case of his killer.  Unfortunately, the director of the Boston branch, Madison Davies, has closed the file on his murder, despite Erica's protest.  In the middle of the night, just as she was finishing up, her partner, John McCoy, tells her that the FBI has been called in to investigate the hanging of an unknown man.

Looking over the scene, taking evidence, and talking to other agents, Erica is able to deduce how the man died.  But not everything is as it seems.  Using her unstable cognitive powers, she manages to find a piece of a child’s wooden toy.  Urged by her partner to seek out an antiques dealer by the name of Rose, Erica begins her journey to unlocking more mysteries of her latent abilities.  And finding out that the item is one part of a French toy called a Le Pendu, and that other parts are left behind by the killer as clues.

As she gathers these pieces to unlock another clue, a mysterious text is sent to her cell phone that brings to her attention an old case of a similar style.  Following this trail leads Erica to Robert Goodman, the husband of the previously hanged victim.  Trying to bring forth a long forgotten memory about the day she died, Erica learns her second power of regression.  After sorting out the memory fragments, she uncovers the name of the murderer: Antony Longmore.

Unfortunately, it is found out that the body discovered WAS Longmore.  Erica soon discovers that the next victim is her boss, Davies.  After an intense shootout in a church, Davies ends up dead, her neck snapped by a noose.  Erica is left wondering why she was targeted and by whom.

Right after Davies’ tragic death, Erica and other agents involved are brought in to be debriefed by the new director of the Boston branch, Samuel McAdams.  McAdams was the Director there years ago, and is returning now to act as the interim director. During her grilling, both Erica and McAdams hear a noise coming from the main office and go out to investigate.  Jared “Sully” Sullivan, a fellow agent with whom Erica has an on-again/off-again relationship, is seen dragged off by the new office assistant, who leaves behind Sully’s ear and a silver musical charm.

The current case being handled by Sully, &quot;The Wise Monkey&quot;, is now tossed into Erica’s lap.  The serial killer is named such due to her MO of cutting out the eyes, ears, and tongues of her victims.  She also leaves small musical charms on their bodies.  The lead suspect is a student at the Berklee College of Music, Kelsey Gardner, and the investigation revolves around trying to learn her whereabouts and what motive she could possibly have for killing the victims.

Erica goes to see the dean of the college, Kelsey’s apartment, Kelsey's former roommate, and her boyfriend’s (Joey Goethals) place of work and residence.  During her investigation, Erica discovers that the dean is secretly using loan money to fund extravagant purchases and that Kelsey confronted him about it whereupon her life was turned upside down because of his embezzlement.

Through the use of another ability gained thanks to Rose’s help, called “synergy”, Erica is able to use the six charms that she has collected up to this point together to get a vision of the same alley where “The Hangman” was killed.  Seeing the past brought on by these charms, she realizes that Joey is the killer, not Kelsey.  Kelsey was in fact, Joey's first victim and he was cutting out his other victims' sense organs to make her perfect again, after feeling remorse over killing her.  However, we also find out that he became a victim of his own modus operandi.

The final confrontation takes place at Joey’s hideout, where Erica has to figure out the way to rescue Sully who’s trapped and next in line to be killed.  Thankfully, she manages to get inside quickly enough to save him.  The end of the episode shows Joey being tossed off a balcony of the Enthon Towers apartments.

===''Episode Three: The Oracle'' (May 16, 2013) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postudios.com/blog/?p=2946 Episode 3 Release Announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;===
Throughout the first two episodes, Erica is introduced to Cordelia Smith.  She also lost a brother six years ago and is first seen confronting Erica about stealing a rose for Scott’s grave at the cemetery.  Getting over this quickly, they hit it off from the start and talk about their brothers.  It is also discovered that Cordelia lives at the Enthon Towers and that she was afraid that someone was out to get her.  Through subterfuge, Erica manages to send a police car to keep tabs on the place.

The entirety of ''The Oracle'' takes place at the Towers and the player is constantly shifting between Cordelia’s past and Erica’s present.  It is revealed very early on in the episode that Cordelia is also a [[Psionics|psion]], with the power of [[precognition]] (she can see the future).  It is also revealed that she is the one that killed off Longmore, Davies, Goethals, and kidnapped Sully.

Erica tries to enter the Towers, but is blocked from doing so by McAdams and an elderly man by the name of Skorobeus.  Managing to sneak in, she goes looking for McCoy who went investigating the death of Joey Goethals.  From this point forward the episode has many flashbacks of what happened six years ago to the Smith family.  For they owned the Towers and this tells the tale of how Max Smith died at the hands of Cordelia.

In her visions of the future, Cordelia saw herself shooting and killing her brother.  She goes to the FBI and begs John McCoy to help because the agents investigating Max, Davies and McAdams, don’t believe her.  Through a series of four flashbacks where the player controls Cordelia and investigates the penthouse in the present as Erica, we discover that Skorobeus and Max are involved in some financial disputes. It is eventually revealed that Cordelia’s other brother, Keith, is in fact elder gentleman’s son, though he does not know this.

Following a hidden pathway to a sub-basement level, Erica confronts John who admits to knowing everything that happened leading up to her brother’s death at the hands of the killer and demands to know why he didn’t say anything.  Discovering Keith’s heavily injured and bandaged body (from the confrontation three years ago during a struggle with Erica) chained up in the room, they find out that Cordelia had kept him down there to do her dirty work to get Erica involved. After releasing him, Erica finds out that Keith is the Cain Killer that Erica has been searching for the past three years (and three episodes).

The episode ends as Erica accidentally shoots John, caught in the fear that her vision of herself getting shot by an shadowy figure was coming true.

===''Episode Four: The Cain Killer'' (September 19, 2013) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postudios.com/blog/?p=3339 Episode 4 Release Announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;===
The series finale starts off with a flashback set three years ago, prior to Scott’s abduction and subsequent death.  On the trail of the Cain Killer, Erica and John have arrived at a warehouse and she is preparing to infiltrate a contact of Cain’s to find out information on the serial killer’s whereabouts.  Her cover is eventually blown and she discovers, much to her horror, that Scott has been taken by Cain and is waiting for her arrival to complete his macabre scene.  She rushes to the cemetery, and since what follows has already been dealt with at the beginning of the first episode, the scene fades to Scott’s funeral.

Fade to Cordelia’s point-of-view.  She tracks Keith to an old family lake house and tries to figure out how to confront him for she knows what he’s done and will do.  Having already met his flaming fate at the hands of Erica, burn scars are all over him and he’s in the bathroom trying to clean up.  Cordelia looks around and finds implements of his MO and grabs some powder to subdue him.  Knocking him out, she takes him away.

In the present day and we see Erica and Cordelia talking.  After a brief kiss, Cordelia tells Erica to ask Rose about Bao Thanh.  Arriving at the antique shop, Erica uses her regression ability to help solidify this memory and reveal that not only was Bao Thanh as psion but so is Rose—she can read minds.  That is why she was helping both Erica and Cordelia with their abilities.

Moving on, Erica returns to the FBI station and is pulled from duty by McAdams because of what she did to John at the end of the previous episode.  Furious, she nonetheless sneaks into the interrogation room and roughs up Skorobeus to find out that Keith used to work out of the Smith family lake house.  Rushing over there, she meets up with Cordelia and after a tense conversation the two agree to work together to take down Keith.

Discovering his room of horrors in the basement, the two use their combined abilities of being able to see the past and future to uncover his next target: Erica’s father.  Before they can leave, McAdams shows up and takes Erica into custody while Cordelia gets away.  Whether she can convince the director to help her or not, they end up back at the cemetery where it all started and Erica has to work with Cordelia again to save her father.  In one final epic confrontation with the Cain Killer, Cordelia sacrifices her own life to take out Cain, and to save Erica from choosing revenge over justice as she once did. In the epilogue, it is revealed that Erica is leaving the FBI to look for and help other psions, and that John died after the shooting in Episode 3, though Erica appears to use her powers to talk to an image of him. She goes to see Sully in the hospital, bringing him the lunch he asked her out for back in the first episode.

==Plot==
In early April 2006, [[Private First Class]] Angel &quot;Sally&quot; Salazar (Izzy Diaz), a young [[United States Army]] soldier serving in the [[Iraq War]], is an aspiring filmmaker who enlisted in the U.S. Army to help him get into film school, as he &quot;did not get into [[University of Southern California|USC]]&quot;. Salazar, based out of Camp &quot;The Oven&quot; Carolina, near [[Samarra|Samarra, Iraq]], is using his [[camcorder]] to record an amateur documentary, ''Tell Me No Lies'', about his deployment in Samarra, to present to a film school of his choice as part of his future enrollment there as a student. Meanwhile, a [[France|French]] documentary crew is shooting a documentary called ''Barrage'' while they are embedded with Salazar's platoon.

The French documentary crew films the soldiers performing their routine duties as they man a [[random checkpoint]] as part of their deployment in Iraq, to help curtail [[insurgent]] logistics. Using mirrors and bomb-sniffing dogs, the soldiers spend their days searching cars at the checkpoint. One day, the French documentary crew manages to videotape an incident in which Private First Class Reno Flake (Patrick Carroll), while manning a [[Humvee]]-mounted [[M2 Browning]] machine gun, fires on a speeding car that tries to rush through the checkpoint. A pregnant woman who was a passenger in the car, is shot and is rushed to the hospital by her husband, and later dies. It is later revealed that the husband, the driver of the car, was simply trying to get his pregnant wife to the hospital, as she was in labor, and misinterpreted the soldiers' commands to stop, believing that they were telling him that he was clear to proceed on through.

Back at Camp Carolina, Salazar, camcorder in hand, asks Flake how he felt about killing a pregnant woman, and he replies that he felt &quot;nothing&quot;, and that it was like &quot;gutting [[catfish]]&quot;. When [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] Lawyer McCoy (Rob Devaney), a married, college-educated soldier, is disgusted by this response, Salazar and McCoy press the issue further, and Flake offers a sarcastic, facetious apology to Salazar's camcorder, enjoying the limelight, which further inflames the situation. [[Sergeant]] Jim Vazquez (Mike Figueroa) defuses the situation before it gets out of hand, stating that, under the [[rules of engagement]] (ROE), Flake's actions were justified.

While on a foot patrol, one of the more experienced soldiers, Master Sergeant Sweet, is killed after stepping on an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]], causing it to detonate. Flake and his friend SPC B.B. Rush (Daniel Stewart Sherman) are enraged by Sweet's death and wish to take revenge by attacking some Iraqis. During a [[poker]] game, Flake and Rush announce their plan to go to the house of an Iraqi family with the goal of raping a 15-year-old girl who is one of the family members. Despite objections from Blix and McCoy, Flake and Rush friend carry out their plan, with Salazar and McCoy accompanying them, the former to videotape the incident and the latter in the hopes of stopping them.

McCoy tries to stop the pair, but he is ordered out of the house at gunpoint. Flake and Rush rape the girl as Salazar films the events using a hidden helmet-mounted video-camera. Afterwards, the girl and her entire family are killed and the girl is burned. McCoy tries to tell Blix about the rape, when Rush confronts the two. Rush grabs McCoy, putting him in a choke-hold at knife-point, demanding he not to report the rape. Afterwards, McCoy is deeply disturbed by the rape and murders, and he tells his father about the incident via webcam. His father, citing the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib incident]], urges him not to report the incident, fearing the publicity generated by it would diminish the reputation of the U.S. in the eyes of the world. Regardless, McCoy ignores his father's objections and reports the rape, going to the [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Criminal Investigation Division]] (CID) to make them aware of the crimes and they subsequently interview him. Salazar too is disturbed by the scenes he recorded, and he meets with an army psychologist to discuss his deteriorating mental state.

While busy making a video for his mother during a foot patrol, a preoccupied Salazar is kidnapped by Iraqi insurgents at knife-point and driven away in a van. Rush notices Salazar missing and his camera, which was left behind during the kidnapping. Later, Salazar is beheaded alive by the insurgents and a video of his murder uploaded onto the internet. Before beheading him, the insurgents claim that his beheading was retribution for Farah's rape. Salazar's decapitated corpse is discovered by a [[Bedouin]] man and subsequently retrieved by U.S. soldiers. The U.S. tries to frame the rape and murder as being perpetrated by insurgents, but a relative rejects the claim, stating that they are of the same religious sect as the supposed insurgents. After the story makes the news, Flake and Rush are arrested and interrogated by the CID and the duo conceitedly admit to the rapes in rambling racist diatribes.

In October 2006, after returning home from Iraq, McCoy is at a bar with his wife when he is asked by his civilian friends to tell them a &quot;war story&quot;. He obliges and tearfully tells them about the rape and murders, before sobbing into his wife's arms.

However, [[Kyle Smith]] gave the movie a 3 star (out of 4) rating, saying, &quot;(It) is a piece of anti-war [[propaganda]] whose aims I don't agree with, but it jolted me nonetheless.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;battlescarred&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/11162007/entertainment/movies/battle_scarred_600609.htm |title=Battle-Scarred |accessdate=2007-11-16 |work=[[New York Post]] |first=Kyle |last=Smith |date=2007-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214010545/http://www.nypost.com/seven/11162007/entertainment/movies/battle_scarred_600609.htm |archivedate=December 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2008|7}}  reviewer [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' gave it a 3 and 1/2 stars (out of 4) stating that &quot;the film is shocking, saddening and frustrating.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071115/REVIEWS/711150303/1023|title=Redacted|author=Ebert, Roger|publisher=RogerEbert.com|date=2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a critical piece about the depiction of war by Hollywood, journalist [[John Pilger]] described the film as &quot;admirable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/film/2010/02/pilger-iraq-oscar-american-war|title=Pilger Iraq Oscar American War|last=Pilger|first=John|work=NewStatesman|date=2010-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film was rated &quot;rotten&quot;, with only 43 percent of the 93 reviews being positive and the average rating 5.3/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1185714-redacted/ |title=Redacted – Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=2008-05-19 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film had an average score of 52 out of 100, based on 30 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/redacted |title=Redacted (2007): Reviews |accessdate=2007-11-25 |publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The French film magazine ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'' chose it as the best film of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cahiersducinema.com/Palmares-2008.html |title=Meilleurs films de l'année 2008 (Best Films of 2008)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
In spite of its modest budget, the film was a box office disaster.  On the weekend of its U.S. release the movie was viewed by approximately 3,000 people, grossing only $25,628.&lt;ref name=&quot;mojo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=redacted.htm|title=Redacted (2007)|publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brandon Gray]], publisher of Box Office Mojo, said the low per-theater ratio made the film a flop for De Palma.&lt;ref name=&quot;hell&quot;/&gt; [[Richard Johnson (columnist)|Richard Johnson]] ran an article titled &quot;De Palma Iraq flick bombs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nypost.com&quot;/&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' also said that the theatrical release had &quot;bombed&quot; in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;/&gt; Total U.S. gross amounted to only $65,388. International release added $716,053 for a total worldwide gross of $781,441.&lt;ref name=&quot;mojo&quot;/&gt; The film's [[budget]] was $5 million.

==Controversies==

===Relation to the real life incident===
De Palma has been criticized for not including the fact that all of the soldiers involved in the real-life [[Mahmudiyah killings]] were [[prosecution|prosecuted]] for the rape and murders perpetrated. The film ends with an official investigation underway, and does not depict a [[trial]] or [[conviction]]. [[Kurt Loder]] wrote in 2007 that &quot;all five of the soldiers involved (in the rape and murder) were [[arrest]]ed and charged, and three have been tried and [[sentence (law)|sentence]]d to 90, 100 and 110 years in prison.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1574478/20071116/story.jhtml &quot;Redacted: Battle Casualty&quot;] by Kurt Loder, MTV.com, Nov. 16, 2007, accessed Nov. 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, at the time of the film's release, the alleged ringleader, PFC [[Steven Dale Green]], was being tried in a [[United States district court|federal court]] in [[Kentucky]], reportedly facing the [[death penalty]].  Since then all legal proceedings have [[Mahmudiyah killings#Legal proceedings|completed.]]

However, De Palma pointed out that the film itself is fictional; [[HDNet]]'s lawyers told him he could not use anything real about the true event – he had to fictionalize it, and was not allowed to refer to the real event in any way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://weblogs.variety.com/thompsononhollywood/2007/09/redacted-in-ven.html |title=De Palma Defends Redacted From Venice |date=2007-09-04 |first=Anne |last=Thompson |work=Variety |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011191332/http://weblogs.variety.com/thompsononhollywood/2007/09/redacted-in-ven.html |archivedate=2007-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political controversy===
The film has attracted political controversy, with claims that, though the film is based on a real event, it portrays U.S. soldiers in a highly negative light, and has contributed to [[anti-American sentiment]] in Iraq and elsewhere; for example the murders by Arid Uka (see below).  Sites like &quot;boycottredacted.com&quot; have accused Brian De Palma and the producer [[Mark Cuban]] of [[treason]], and called for the general public to avoid watching the film. Republican [[Duncan Hunter]], Ranking Member of the [[House Armed Services Committee]] complained in a letter to the chairman of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] that the film &quot;portrays American service personnel in Iraq as uncontrollable misfits and criminals&quot; and &quot;ignores the many acts of heroism performed by our Soldiers, Marines, Airmen and Sailors in Iraq.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071122/NATION/111220043/1002&amp;template=printart |title=War film's portrayal of soldiers draws fire from GOP lawmaker |date=2007-11-22 |publisher=Washington Times }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critic [[Kyle Smith]] opined that &quot;De Palma isn't trying to insult the troops but illustrating how any war puts men in impossible situations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;battlescarred&quot;/&gt; De Palma has stated that the film provides a realistic portrait of U.S. troops and how &quot;the presentation of our troops has been whitewashed&quot; by media. He expected that its graphic images would stir public debate about the conduct of U.S. soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N18464892.htm Director De Palma disturbed over Iraq film edit] [[Reuters]] October 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] called for protests of ''Redacted'' and against Mark Cuban. O'Reilly claims that the film demeans U.S. soldiers and may incite violence against them, and he has called on ticketholders to bring signs to [[Dallas Mavericks]] games and all theaters showing the movie, stating 'Support the Troops'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://billoreilly.com/show?action=viewTVShow&amp;showID=1603 BillOReilly.com: The O'Reilly Factor Flash&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Cuban has responded, saying &quot;The movie is fully pro-troops. The hero of the movie is a soldier who stands up for what is right in the face of adversity... I think that the concept that the enemy will see these films and use it as motivation is total nonsense. We have no plans of translating these movies to Arabic or other Middle Eastern languages...It's really easy to hate, its really hard to think issues through on their own merits. Anything that makes people think about issues is a good thing.&quot; Cuban also pointed out that, through the Fallen Patriots charitable fund that he set up and finances, over $2.5 million has been donated to soldiers in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blogmaverick.com/2007/09/04/me-and-bill-oreilly/|title=Me and Bill OReilly|date=2007-09-04|author=Mark Cuban}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to publish an email he received from a soldier wounded in Iraq, who wrote that &quot;[Iraqis have] already formed their opinions of us and very little we do or say is going to change their minds. One movie, regardless of its subject matter, is not going to overcome their personal feelings about things like Abu-Ghraib, the criminal acts discussed in Redacted, their fears about security and lost loved ones&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blogmaverick.com/2007/11/17/subject-this-soldiers-perspective-on-the-redacted-issue/|date=2007-11-17|title=Subject: This soldiers perspective on the Redacted issue.|author=Mark Cuban}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film reaction===
During a [[New York Film Festival]] press conference for the film, De Palma mentioned that ''Redacted'' is itself [[Redaction|redacted]], due to [[Magnolia Pictures]] owner Mark Cuban &quot;being disturbed&quot; by the ending [[photo montage]]'s imagery. A voice from the audience called out &quot;That's not true&quot;; with the speaker identifying himself as Eamonn Bowles, president of Magnolia Pictures. The producer of the film later appeared on stage to explain that the images were taken out not because they were disturbing, but because of concerns about the possibility that relatives of the dead persons appearing on the photographs might bring lawsuits for emotional distress and the like. Magnolia, he said, had been put in &quot;an untenable legal position&quot; making the movie uninsurable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN1846489220071019 &quot;Director De Palma disturbed over Iraq film edit&quot;] Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview conducted the day after the uproar at the press conference, Cuban said, &quot;There is no way I am going to include images of people who have been severely wounded or maimed and killed when the possibility exists that their families could unknowingly see the images and recognize a loved one.&quot; He also said that Magnolia had offered De Palma the option of buying the film back from the distributor in order to release it himself and &quot;absorb 100 percent of the risk&quot;, but that De Palma did not accept. De Palma responded, &quot;That's not true. He never offered me that opportunity, he never answered my phone calls.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No one wants to know|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Hattenstone, Simon|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,2263424,00.html|date=2008-03-08|accessdate=2008-03-10 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 2, 2011, a man [[2011 Frankfurt Airport shooting|shot and killed two U.S. airmen at the Frankfurt Airport in Frankfurt, Germany]], and wounded two others, maiming one. The suspect was identified as a 21-year-old man, Arid Uka, a German citizen of [[Albania]]n descent, who had worked at the airport. Uka claimed that he shot the airman because of a video he had watched on [[YouTube#Controversial content|YouTube]] the day before, which supposedly showed [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] soldiers (actors from the movie redacted) raping a child (actress).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Antikriegsfilm soll Flughafen-Attentäter aufgestachelt haben |publisher=ECHO Online |url=http://www.echo-online.de/region/rhein-main/Antikriegsfilm-soll-Flughafen-Attentaeter-aufgestachelt-haben;art7943,1672773 |date=2011-03-11|accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The March 6, 2011 edition of the German television show ''[[Der Spiegel|Spiegel TV Magazine]]'' identified the video as a clip from the movie ''Redacted''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Attentat: Vergewaltigungsvideo Auslöser? |work=Bild |url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/news/telegramm/news-ticker,rendertext=16689496.html |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a confession, Arid Uka stated that he shot at the U.S. airmen because he believed that they were going to commit additional rapes based on what the video footage from ''Redacted'' had portrayed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/8732756/German-Islamist-terrorist-confesses-and-blames-fake-jihad-rape-video-for-inspiring-his-crime.html German Islamist terrorist confesses and blames fake jihad rape video for inspiring his crime]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/10/arid-uka-frankfurt-sentenced_n_1267770.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Eline | last=Gordts | title=Arid Uka, Frankfurt Airport Shooter, Sentenced To Life | date=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''L.A. Noire''''' is a [[neo-noir]] [[Detective fiction|detective]] [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Team Bondi]] and published by [[Rockstar Games]]. It was released on 17 May 2011 for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]], and on 8 November 2011 for [[Microsoft Windows]]; a re-release for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] was released worldwide on 14 November 2017. ''L.A. Noire'' is set in [[Los Angeles]] in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five [[LAPD|divisions]]. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed.

The game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of [[film noir]]—stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity—along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes for its in-game cases, based upon what was reported by the Los Angeles media in 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;RealLife_Crime&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/14351/the-red-lipstick-murder-real-crime-stories-of-1947-los-angeles-t.html |title=Real Life &quot;Red Lipstick Murder&quot; of 1947 |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in [[black and white]]. Various plot elements refer to the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as ''[[The Naked City]]'', ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/13771/rockstar-recommends-chinatown.html |title=Rockstar Recommends: &quot;Chinatown&quot; |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[The Black Dahlia (novel)|The Black Dahlia]]'', and ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]''.

''L.A. Noire'' is notable for using [[Depth Analysis]]' newly developed technology [[MotionScan]], whereby the actors portraying the game's characters were recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techland.com/2010/11/24/why-rockstars-l-a-noire-wont-be-another-gta-or-red-dead/1/ |title=Why Rockstar’s &quot;L.A.

== Gameplay ==
''L.A. Noire'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[neo-noir]] [[Crime fiction|crime]] game played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. Players complete cases—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story. The game also features a mode which allows the player to [[Nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] the [[open world]] and engage in optional activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Game Trailers LA Noire review |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/review-l-a-noire/713929|date=16 May 2011|accessdate=19 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The world features multiple landmarks, which are all based on real monuments from 1940s Los Angeles.

The game takes place in the city of [[Los Angeles]], in the year 1947, with the player assuming the role of [[Los Angeles Police Department]] officer, and later detective, Cole Phelps.&lt;ref name=Gamespot-Review/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockstargames.com/lanoire/information/ |title=L.A. Noire |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date= |accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game starts with Phelps as a uniformed patrolman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockstargames.com/lanoire/features/patrol/ |title=L.A. Noire |publisher=Rockstar Games |date= |accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and follows his career as he advances through the police department bureaus (desks) of Traffic, Homicide, Vice and Arson. Each desk gives the player a new partner who will help Phelps in his investigation of a number of cases based on a specific type of crime. The game assigns the player with cases that they must solve. After each case, players receive a rating of 1–5 stars depending on their performance in both interrogations and searching for clues. In some cases, when searching an area for clues to the crime, the player can also find newspapers. Besides reading the story, the newspapers give access to a short cinematic that either covers a part of the game's overarching plot or a flashback to Phelps' war memories. Near the end of the final desk, players assume control of private investigator Jack Kelso, who becomes the [[player character]] for most of the rest of the game; although different in appearance and personality, he controls identically to Phelps.

[[File:LA Noire interrogation.jpg|left|thumb|250px|When interrogating witnesses and suspects, players have the option to believe them, doubt them, or accuse them of lying.]]
The game blends investigative elements with fast-paced action sequences, including chases, combat, interrogations and gunfights.&lt;ref name=Gamespot-Review/&gt; Players use [[Melee (gaming)|melee]] attacks and firearms to fight enemies, and may run, jump or use vehicles to navigate the world. In combat, [[auto-aim]] and a [[cover system]] can be used as assistance against enemies. Should player characters take damage, the character's [[Health (gaming)|health]] will gradually regenerate. Weapons can only be used in appropriate circumstances, such as during firefights. When driving vehicles, the player have the option to skip directly to the destination by nominating their partner as the driver. The player can also ask the partner for directions. In addition to storyline cases, the player may engage in an optional 40 side-investigations, known as Street Crimes, that are not related to the case that they are working on. Some street crimes will feature characters from previous cases.

Suspects and witnesses in a case can be interrogated for information, when the interviewee responds, the player is given the option to either believe them, doubt them, or accuse them of lying.{{efn|These options are presented as &quot;Truth&quot;, &quot;Doubt&quot;, and &quot;Lie&quot; in the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows versions.

==Plot==
{{plot|date=December 2017}}
{{See also|List of L.A. Noire characters}}
Following the end of [[World War II]], Cole Phelps ([[Aaron Staton]]), a decorated [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] veteran of the [[Pacific War|Pacific Campaign]], returns to [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]] to live with his family while taking on work as a Patrol Officer of the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]]. In 1947, working with his partner Officer Ralph Dunn ([[Rodney Scott]]), Phelps successfully solves a major murder case and impresses his superiors, who promote him to detective. Working alongside Stefan Bekowsky (Sean McGowan) in Traffic, and then Finbarr &quot;Rusty&quot; Galloway ([[Michael McGrady]]) in Homicide, Phelps earns a reputation for solving difficult cases that eventually land him a promotion into Vice. During this time, he begins falling for German lounge singer Elsa Lichtmann ([[Erika Heynatz]]) and soon has an affair with her. Unknown to him, Roy Earle ([[Adam J. Harrington]]), his partner in Vice and a corrupt cop, uses this information to help several prominent figures in the city, including the Chief of Police, cover up a major scandal by making him a media scapegoat, in exchange for a place in a syndicate known as the &quot;Suburban Redevelopment Fund&quot; (SRF)—a development program that supplies housing for homebound WWII veterans. When his adultery is exposed, Phelps becomes disgraced in the LAPD, while his wife ends their marriage.

Prior to his demotion to Arson, Phelps had found that several Marines of his former unit had been selling morphine [[syrette]]s stolen from the ship that had taken them home, the ''SS Coolridge'', which had later led to most being assassinated by mobsters working for [[Mickey Cohen]] ([[Patrick Fischler]]), who controlled the drug trade and had resented the competition; most of the stolen drugs remains unaccounted for by the time he is demoted. While investigating a pair of suspicious house fires with his partner in Arson, Herschel Biggs ([[Keith Szarabajka]]), Phelps notes a connection between them and a recent housing development, known as &quot;Elysian Fields&quot;, but is warned by Earle to back off from tycoon developer Leland Monroe ([[John Noble]]). Seeking help to investigate the development, Phelps advises Elsa to refuse a life insurance payout in order to prompt his old comrade Jack Kelso ([[Gil McKinney]]), now an investigator for the California Fire &amp; Life insurance company, to look into the matter. Kelso quickly discovers that the development is using unsuitable building materials, and becomes an investigator for the Assistant D.A. whereupon he soon learns that Monroe and his former employer, Curtis Benson, the Vice President of California Fire &amp; Life, are involved in the SRF syndicate.

Kelso and Phelps eventually learn from their investigations that the Fund is merely a front to conceal its true purpose: to defraud the US Federal Government. Run by several local businessmen, dignitaries, as well as Monroe and the Chief of Police, the syndicate had learnt about the proposed route for the [[Southern California freeways|Whitnall Parkway]] through the [[Wilshire, Los Angeles|Wilshire]] district of the city, and thus bought the land it would run through. Monroe then built communities of &quot;matchstick&quot; houses, while Fire &amp; Life falsely claimed the land was a higher value, knowing that the government would pay whatever the land was worth in order to gain [[eminent domain]] over it. Further investigations reveals that Courtney Sheldon (Chad Todhunter), a headstrong [[corpsman]] of Phelps and Kelso's former unit, had been involved in the theft of the morphine. The remainder of the morphine had been given to Sheldon's mentor and [[Popular psychology|pop-psychiatrist]] Harlan Fontaine (Peter Blomquist), who sold it on to finance the Fund and murdered Sheldon after he began questioning the syndicate's plans. Following a shoot-out at Monroe's mansion, Kelso discovers that the SRF had used Ira Hogeboom (J. Marvin Campbell), a former [[flamethrower]] operator from Phelps' and Kelso's unit, to help them with their plans. Hogeboom, suffering from [[PTSD]] and [[schizophrenia]] after inadvertently killing a large number of civilians on Phelps' orders during the [[Battle of Okinawa]], had been unknowingly manipulated by Fontaine to torch the houses of holdouts who refused to sell out to the SRF, until eventually losing his sanity completely after he inadvertently incinerates a house with an entire family inside.

After learning that Hogeboom had murdered Fontaine and kidnapped Elsa, Phelps and Kelso pursue him into the [[Los Angeles River]] Tunnels as a heavy rain begins, fighting their way through corrupt policemen and thugs. The pair rescue Elsa, with Kelso killing Hogeboom to put him out of his mental anguish. With the water level rising, the group use an open manhole to escape, but Phelps is swept away in the current and killed. Whilst the SRF scam is exposed, several members escape justice by making a deal with the Assistant D.A. to testify. They attend Phelps's funeral, each delivering eulogies to his memory, much to the disgust of Elsa. Biggs remarks to Kelso that Phelps was never his friend, to which Kelso agrees but responds that he was never Phelps' enemy.

An [[Post-credits scene|epilogue]] flashback scene soon reveals that Kelso had known about the stolen morphine and Sheldon's involvement, after they and their other fellow Marines found the surplus supply on their ship home. However, Kelso refused to be involved in Sheldon's scheme to sell the drugs along with the other Marines, telling them all that they will lose his respect for them as Marines if they go through with the drug profiting, setting in motion the events of the game.

==Development==
{{Main|Development of L.A. Noire}}
[[Team Bondi]] began to [[Development of L.A. Noire|develop ''L.A. Noire'']] following their founding in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bramwell&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Team Bondi – The First Interview |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=54626 |first=Tom |last=Bramwell |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=20 February 2004 |accessdate=15 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially due to be published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], the publishing rights were later handed over to [[Rockstar Games]] in September 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;R-Pub&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Surette |first=Tim |url=http://gamespot.com/news/rockstar-gets-la-noire-6158595 |title=Rockstar gets L.A.

Unlike other games by Rockstar, which run on their proprietary [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]], ''L.A. Noire'' uses a custom engine, which includes a combination of facial motion capture and animation software.&lt;ref name=&quot;Screens&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/02/15/new-exclusive-screens-for-l-a-noire.aspx|title=Exclusive New L.A. Noire Screens |last=Helgeson |first=Matt |publisher=''[[Game Informer]]'' |date=15 February 2010 |accessdate=21 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is notable for being the first to use [[MotionScan]], developed by Team Bondi sister company [[Depth Analysis]]. MotionScan functions by recording actors with 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a human face. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players are required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge whether or not they are lying.&lt;ref name=&quot;MotionScan&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=L.A.

The game is set in 1947 Los Angeles, and the open world was modelled accordingly. To model the city, the developers used aerial photographs taken by photographer Robert Spence.&lt;ref name=VG247_Photos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/05/18/la-noires-version-of-los-angeles-is-thanks-to-1920s-daredevil/ |title=LA Noire’s version of Los Angeles is thanks to 1920s daredevil |last=Citizen |first=Jessica |publisher=[[VG247]] |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=20 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team also used the photographs to create traffic patterns and public transport routes, as well as the location and condition of buildings.&lt;ref name=VG247_Photos/&gt; While striving to recreate an accurate model of 1947 Los Angeles, the team also took some artistic license, such as including the appearance of the film set for [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]''; the set had actually been dismantled in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/16081/la-noires-los-angeles-landmarks.html |title=L.A. Noire's Los Angeles Landmarks |author=R* Q |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date=16 May 2011 |accessdate=21 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to recreating the city as it was in 1947, all of the in-game cases that the developers worked upon were each inspired in some part by the actual real-life crimes that the city's media reported on during that year. Each of the game's cases features at least a few of the real-life elements that were reported in newspaper articles of that time, with one example of a case that developers found inspiration for being the &quot;''Red Lipstick Murder''&quot;. The case, part of the game's Homicide Desk, is based upon the facts and elements that were mentioned in articles about the real-life, unsolved murder of Jeanne French, a woman who was found dead in exactly the same conditions as the victim of the in-game case is found in, including the M.O. used on the victim, the state the body was left in, the lipstick message found on the body, and the initial suspect being the victim's husband, yet the in-game case differs from this in that it is closed by the main protagonist and not becoming a cold case towards the end of its investigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;RealLife_Crime&quot;/&gt;

=== Music production ===
{{Main|Music of L.A. Noire}}
''L.A. Noire'' features [[Music of L.A. Noire|an original score]]. The game's score accompanies the gameplay, alerting players at specific times. Like other games published by Rockstar, ''L.A. Noire'' also contains licensed music tracks provided by an in-game radio. Over thirty songs, from artists such as [[Billie Holiday]], [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Ella Fitzgerald]], feature in the game. To work on the score, the team engaged Andrew Hale and [[Simon Hale]], as well as [[Woody Jackson]], who had previously collaborated with the team on ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/05/09/rockstar-reveals-a-pair-of-soundtracks-for-l-a-noire/ |title=Rockstar reveals a pair of soundtracks for L.A.

When [[The Real Tuesday Weld]] were commissioned to compose the original compositions, they sought vocals that could &quot;evoke the period&quot;, ultimately falling upon [[Claudia Brücken]]. Three vocal tracks were produced: &quot;(I Always Kill) The Things I Love&quot;, &quot;Guilty&quot;, and &quot;Torched Song&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;soundtrack&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/lanoire/features/soundtrack/ |title=Features: In-Game Soundtrack |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |accessdate=24 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's score won the award for Best Original Score at the [[8th British Academy Games Awards|2012 Bafta Video Games Awards]].&lt;ref name=BAFTA/&gt;

''L.A. Noire'' received &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews from critics, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=MCPS3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/la-noire |title=L.A.

Noire'' has been widely praised for its advances in storytelling and facial animation technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;industrygamers1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrygamers.com/news/la-noire-currently-tracking-40-behind-red-dead-redemption/ |title=LA Noire Currently Tracking 40% Behind Red Dead Redemption |publisher=IndustryGamers |date=15 June 2011 |accessdate=18 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829060111/http://www.industrygamers.com/news/la-noire-currently-tracking-40-behind-red-dead-redemption|archivedate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first review was published by UK newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', which awarded the game a perfect score, and stated &quot;Ever since it first worked out how to assemble pixels so that they resembled something more recognisable than aliens, the games industry has dreamed of creating one thing above all else – a game that is indistinguishable from a film, except that you can control the lead character. With ''L.A. Noire'', it just might, finally, have found the embodiment of that particular holy grail.&quot;&lt;ref name=GuardianReview&gt;{{cite news|last=Boxer |first=Steve |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/may/16/la-noire-game-review |title=L.A.

[[IGN]] said, &quot;''L.A. Noire'' may not reach the emotional heights of a game like ''[[Heavy Rain]]'', but it's something everyone must try out. It reaches high and almost succeeds as a brilliant new type of video game narrative.&quot;&lt;ref name=IGN-Review&gt;{{cite web|author=Hilary Goldstein |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/05/16/la-noire-review |title=L.A.

Noire'' floors you out of the gate, loses some steam due to repetition, but eventually wins the day thanks to its subtlety, attention to detail, and stunning character interaction.&quot;&lt;ref name=GTR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/reviews/bl633d/l-a--noire-review |title=L.A.

''L.A. Noire'' takes an old school approach toward its storytelling. It's a much slower approach, similar to older movies, with a heavy emphasis on detail. It is that attention to detail that sets ''L.A. Noire'' apart from other games and makes it enjoyable to play.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GameZoneReview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Liebl |first=Matt |url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/l-a-noire-review |title=L.A.

''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' praised the facial technology, and pointed out that while there are no other major aspects of the game that had not been done better elsewhere, the fact that Team Bondi had brought together such a wide range of game genres in such a stylish, atmospheric, and cohesive manner was an achievement that few developers had managed.&lt;ref name=EdgeReview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/reviews/la-noire-review|title=LA Noire Review |publisher=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |date=18 May 2011 |accessdate=19 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522072449/http://www.next-gen.biz/features/la-noire-review |archivedate=22 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |quote=&quot;With the exception of its facial capture, there's no single aspect of Team Bondi’s title that hasn’t been done better elsewhere, but few developers have brought such a diffuse set of genres together so atmospherically, stylishly or cohesively.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Joystiq]]'' stated that &quot;''L.A. Noire'' may not always be 'fun' in the traditional sense, but it's also unsatisfied with being 'merely fun-, and the result of that aspiration is something that no one who cares about video games should miss.&quot;&lt;ref name=JReview&gt;{{cite web|last=McElroy |first=Justin |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/05/16/la-noire-review/ |title=L.A.

''[[PlayStation: The Official Magazine]]'' stated that &quot;In many ways, ''L.A. Noire'' is similar to an AMC series... It's a slow build, but once hooked, we couldn't get enough of this provocative adventure, with its compelling characters and innovative gameplay. It's not perfect, but it's also unlike anything else on the PS3 right now.&quot;&lt;ref name=PTOM/&gt; ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' concluded with &quot;Yes, it's flawed, but ''L.A. Noire'' is an honest-to-goodness detective crime thriller – a genuine breath of fresh air that values narrative and story above all else in an age where scripted action sequences and online deathmatch rule the day. It's the closest thing Xbox has to PlayStation's unique adventurer ''Heavy Rain''.&quot;&lt;ref name=OXM/&gt;''[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]'' gave the game 92%, and concluded that ''L.A. Noire'' is &quot;Rockstar's most mature take on open-world fun to date, brought to life with incredible tech.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=L.A. Noire (PS3) |magazine=[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]] |date=July 2011 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the overall positive reception, some reviewers thought that the game had too many redundancies in the cases and left too little control to the player,&lt;ref name=IGN-Review/&gt; leading to the game being boring at times.&lt;ref name=GI/&gt; Although [[1UP.com|1UP]] gave it a perfect score, they also warned that the extended cut-scenes in the game could make some players feel they lost control of the action.&lt;ref name=1up_Review&gt;{{cite web |last=Atienza |first=Jobert |url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/la-noire-review?pager.offset=0 |title=L.A.

Responding to criticism that accused the character's bodies of being lifeless, despite the game's use of motion capture, Brendan McNamara, the game's director and writer, stated in an interview with ''Eurogamer'', &quot;People were saying people were dead from the neck down. That's because we had all this animation in the neck and all this animation in the face, but the clothes don't move. Once you get to the level that people can actually see that level of realism, then people expect to see clothes moving and the rest of the body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games.&quot; In the same interview McNamara also responded to queries about why Phelps sometimes responds with particularly aggressive lines of dialogue during interrogation scenes. &quot;It's funny. A lot of people say Aaron turns into a psycho. When we originally wrote the game the questions you asked were coax, force and lie. It was actually force because it was a more aggressive answer. That's the way we recorded it. But when the game came out it was truth, doubt or lie. Everyone always says Aaron on the second question is a psycho. So that's not his fault.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yin-Poole |first=Wesley |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-11-09-mcnamara-why-you-thought-la-noires-characters-were-dead-from-the-neck-down |title=McNamara: why you thought LA Noire's characters were &quot;dead from the neck down&quot; |publisher=''Eurogamer'' |date=9 November 2011 |accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sales===
On the day of the game's U.S. release, shares in Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar Games' parent company, closed up 7.75% on the day; a three-year high for the company. The rise was attributed to the positive reviews that ''L.A.

&quot;'''Fear Her'''&quot; is the twelfth episode of the [[Wentworth (season 2)|second season]] of the Australian television drama ''[[Wentworth (TV series)|Wentworth]]'', and the twenty-second episode overall. The plot of the episode sees [[Bea Smith (Wentworth)|Bea Smith]] ([[Danielle Cormack]]) take her revenge against [[Brayden Holt]] (Reef Ireland) after escaping from the hospital during the previous episode. Other storylines focus on [[Franky Doyle (Wentworth)|Franky Doyle]]'s ([[Nicole da Silva]]) downfall as top dog, Doreen Anderson ([[Shareena Clanton]]) telling Nash Taylor (Luke McKenzie) about their baby, and Liz Birdsworth ([[Celia Ireland]]) being re-arrested after being found in possession of a murder weapon.

==Plot==
The episode begins with Bea waking up at [[Debbie Smith (Wentworth)|her daughter]]'s grave. Bea then walks into town and does her best to blend in within everyone around her and not draw attention to herself. Meanwhile [[Will Jackson (Wentworth)|Will]] and [[Joan Ferguson (Wentworth)|Joan]] talk over the phone about Bea. Joan tells Will not to come back until he finds her. Joan then questions Franky, Doreen, [[Maxine Conway|Maxine]], [[Jess Warner (Wentworth)|Jess]] and other prisoners about what they know about Bea's plans. Vera then comes in with Bea's phone records and details about Bea sending Liz a package.

In the locker room, Linda and Fletch talk about his impending transfer to another prison. Vera comes in and demands that he goes and speaks with Ferguson. Fletch is then interrogated about how his swipe card got into Bea's hands. Fletch defends himself against Joan. Vera tries to defend Fletch but Ferguson does not care.

Sky is in the prison exercise yard talking about Bea's escape to Boomer and Franky. Franky calls Bea a coward. Franky wants to teach Maxine a lesson but Boomer informs Franky that nobody will fight for her anymore. Kim visits Franky in her cell and informs her that her parole has been approved. Franky tells Kim to leave her.

Fletch sees that inmate Kelly is being transferred and he tries to stop it. He gets into the prison van and tells the driver to drive.

Meanwhile Bea goes to visit Liz at the halfway house. Liz is surprised to see Bea outside of the prison. Liz tries to stop Bea from going after Brayden by telling her that she got rid of it. Bea does not believe her. Liz helps Bea get away when the police come to interview Liz.

Fletch learns that Ferguson physically assaults inmates to silence them. Kelly then tells Fletch about Jianna and Ferguson. Fletch then realises that Ferguson also has it in for Will. Fletch tried to call Will but the call was rejected. Fletch confronts Ferguson about everything he learned. Fletch was recording their whole conversation. Joan has Fletch escorted out of the prison.

Doreen hears Nash yelling for her from outside and she exposes that she is having his baby and he is very pleased. Will meets with Liz and learns of Bea's plans, but he then lies to Ferguson about where she is going. Ferguson has Vera back her up that Jackson and Bea are in a relationship. Fletch goes to Will's house to try and warn him, but he is struck by a van.

Bea finds her way to Brayden's work shop, she witnesses Brayden trying to inject Carly Slater and points a gun at Brayden and lets Carly leave. Will then comes in shortly after and talks Bea out of shooting Brayden. Brayden then smirks after Bea drops the gun, Bea shoots him in the head. Will and Bea go peacefully out to the police where both of them are arrested.

The prisoners watch on TV about everything that has happened while police come and arrest Liz. Boomer is shocked when they see that Will was also arrested. Bea is returned to the prison where she addresses Joan as Freak. Franky tells everybody in H Block that Bea is top dog now.

==Reception==
This episode was nominated for an award from [[AWGIE Awards|Australian Writers Guild]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fremantlemedia.com.au/news/awgie-nominations-fma|title=AWGIE nominations for FMA|work=Fremantle Media|date=24 July 2015|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review from [[AfterEllen]] states &quot;HOLY SHIT THAT WAS AWESOME. After a season of dreary disappointment, the Season 2 finale reminded me why I went from writing a one-off review of this obscure Australian drama to emailing Karman Kregloe to say, &quot;This is the best show I've ever seen and I am doing full recaps.” It had twists, action, drama, AND EVEN JOY (what a concept). Now my greatest hope is that ''Wentworth'' can maintain this energy and dynamism for its third season.&quot;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterellen.com/tv/223944-wentworth-recap-2-12-teal-is-the-warmest-color|title=&quot;Wentworth&quot; recap (2.12): Teal is the Warmest Color|work=AfterEllen|date=6 August 2014|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Anya's Ghost''''' is a [[coming-of-age story|coming-of-age]]&lt;ref name=&quot;2016-06-15 Bustle&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2011-05-31 Wired&quot; /&gt; [[ghost story]]&lt;ref name=&quot;bb20110406&quot; /&gt; in [[graphic novel]] format.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAT20110619&quot; /&gt;  The first book by &lt;!-- uncited: Russian-born American --&gt;cartoonist [[Vera Brosgol]], ''Anya's Ghost'' was published on June 7, 2011.

In the novel, unpopular Anya befriends the ghost of Emily, a girl around Anya's age who died 90 years earlier.  After failing to make Anya popular and happy, Emily becomes manipulative and controlling, leading Anya to discover the truth about Emily's death.

''Anya's Ghost'' took four years from inception to publication, and is drawn predominantly in hues of violet.  Well received by critics, ''Anya's Ghost'' is the recipient of [[Cybils Award|Cyblis]], [[Harvey Award|Harvey]], and [[Eisner Award|Eisner]] awards.  Production on a [[film adaptation]] of the novel was supposed to begin by the end of 2017.

==Plot==
Annushka Borzakovskaya&lt;ref name=&quot;LAT20110619&quot; /&gt; (Anya) is a Russian émigré living in the United States with her mother and brother (Sasha).  Unpopular at her [[New England]]&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT20110608&quot; /&gt; private school, Anya skips school and walks through a nearby forest.  Not seeing it, Anya falls into a dry well and finds herself alongside a human skeleton.  The skeleton's ghost, a shy, homely girl named Emily appears and explains that she too fell down the well and died of dehydration after breaking her neck ninety years ago.  Emily wishes to befriend and help Anya, but cannot move far from her bones.  Anya is soon rescued by a passerby, but Emily's skeleton remains undiscovered.

Emily later appears to Anya at school, Anya having inadvertently taken a finger bone from Emily's skeleton.  Anya decides to keep the bone after Emily helps her cheat on a biology exam and spy on her crush, Sean.  Emily gives her full name as Emily Reilly and explains that her fiancé died fighting in [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], and that her parents were murdered at home.  She was running from the killer when she fell down the well.  Anya promises to find Emily's killer, while Emily agrees to help Anya fit in at school and win over Sean.  As their friendship develops, Anya drifts away from her one friend at school (Siobhan) while Emily becomes disinterested in discovering her murderer's identity.

At Emily's insistence, Anya dresses up and goes to a party attended by Sean and his girlfriend Elizabeth.  There, Anya discovers that Sean habitually [[infidelity|cheats]] on Elizabeth with her consent.  Distraught, Anya leaves the party, which makes Emily angry and confused for she believed Anya and Sean were destined for each other.  Anya later notices Emily becoming more controlling and adjusting her appearance by straightening her hair and smoking ghostly cigarettes.  Anya goes to the library without Emily to research the killer; there she learns that Emily had no fiancé, but had instead murdered a young couple in their home after her [[unrequited love]] rejected her, and then died running from the authorities.

When Anya returns home, the finger bone is missing.  After being confronted with the truth, Emily shows that she is [[psychokinesis|capable of moving solid objects]], implying she put her finger bone in Anya's bag.  Emily begins threatening Anya's family to make Anya comply, even causing Anya's mother to fall down the stairs.  After Emily appears before Sasha, he reveals he found the bone earlier; Anya retrieves it and runs to the well, pursued by Emily.

Once there, Anya confronts and accuses Emily of trying to live [[vicariousness|vicariously]] through her.  Emily rebukes Anya, saying that she is no better&lt;!--  (Anya having lied to Sean and distanced herself from Siobhan) --&gt;, and that the two of them are more alike then she wants to admit.  After Emily fails to push Anya into the well, Anya drops the bone back in.  Emily then possesses her own skeleton, and climbs out to give further chase.  Anya stops and instead convinces Emily of the futility of her situation, causing the tearful ghost to dissipate, and the skeleton to fall back into the well.  Later, Anya convinces her school to fill the well and rekindles her friendship with Siobhan.

==Development==
===Writing===
Brosgol conceived the character of Anya when she was working on ''[[Put the Book Back on the Shelf]]'' (2006), a comics anthology based on the music of the Scottish [[indie pop]] band [[Belle and Sebastian]].  She wrote a short story about a disaffected schoolgirl to accompany the song &quot;Family Tree&quot; (from the band's 2000 album ''[[Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant]]'').  Brosgol didn't finish the story, but enjoyed drawing &quot;that character with her fat little legs and cigarettes.&quot;  Then, after reading [[Haruki Murakami]]'s novel ''[[The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle]]'', she decided her unnamed character should fall down a well.  The rest of the story came later, drawn from the author's own life and other inspiration.&lt;ref name=&quot;VBblog20111231&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production===
As ''Anya's Ghost'' was her first book,&lt;ref name=&quot;WIRED20111015&quot; /&gt; Brosgol said that its production was an exercise in trial and error.  Brosgol does not work from a script, saying that &quot;the art and the dialogue come at the same time and one suggests the other&quot;.  She prefers to illustrate events rather than use dialogue in her comics.  Working from a detailed outline, Brosgol drew [[thumbnail]]s of each panel—two to a page in a [[Moleskine]] notebook—and wrote the dialogue as she went along.&lt;ref name=&quot;VBblog20110616&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://verabee.com/2011/06/process/
 | title = process

 | dead-url = no
 | access-date = 2016-12-19
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From her thumbnails, Brosgol used her [[Wacom Cintiq]] to draw a rough version of the ultimate art.  This rough version of ''Anya's Ghost'' went to her editor for approval.  After approval, Brosgol went back through her rough draft and &quot;tightened the roughs up just enough so that [she] could ink them&quot;.  She then used paintbrushes (being especially particular about her [[Winsor &amp; Newton]] Series 7s) to paint on [[Canson]] translucent [[vellum]] atop her printed-out rough draft.  Brosgol inked the [[panel (comics)|panels]] and [[speech balloon]]s first, adding in the lettering digitally later with a custom font developed for her by [[John Martz]]; she [[colorist|colored]] the novel in [[Adobe Photoshop]].&lt;ref name=&quot;VBblog20110616&quot; /&gt;

''Anya's Ghost'' is drawn in what [[Pamela Paul]] called a &quot;deep violet palette&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT20110608&quot; /&gt; that Brosgol called &quot;purpley-blue&quot;.  The artist herself said she chose the colors &quot;for no other reason than I like purpley-blue and I think it feels right for the story&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;VBblog20110616&quot; /&gt;  [[Susan Carpenter]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' interpreted the colors as &quot;a subtle underscoring of Anya's bruised ego&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAT20110619&quot; /&gt;

===Publication===
Having worked on [[Kazu Kibuishi]]'s [[Flight (comics)|''Flight'']] comics, Brosgol contacted his [[talent agent]] Judith Hansen who had agreed to look at the work of anybody involved.  After completing the art for ''Anya's Ghost'' in 2009, Brosgol brought it to Hansen, who agreed to represent the artist.  Brosgol finished the cover art in 2010, and then &quot;there's a full year on the end for printing, and marketing, and all of that which comes with a book publisher.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WIRED20111015&quot; /&gt;  The book was published on June 7, 2011&lt;ref name=&quot;2011-06-07 Kirkus&quot; /&gt; by [[First Second Books]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HARVEY2012&quot; /&gt;

'''&quot;Kitty&quot;''' is an episode of [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]. Kitty introduced [[FBI Agent]] [[Avery Ryan]] from [[CSI: Cyber]] which this episode served as the [[backdoor pilot]] of the series. Despite being credited [[Jorja Fox]] and [[Jon Wellner]] who portray [[Sara Sidle]] and [[Henry Andrews (CSI)|Henry Andrews]] do not appear in this episode (although the latter does appear in a deleted scene).

==Plot==
The episode begins with a house's security system being disabled. Then a dark figure walks into a bedroom and murders the woman in the bedroom. The scene cuts to [[Jim Brass]] ([[Paul Guilfoyle]]) yelling orders at the police officers and trying to get rid of the press. [[Nick Stokes]] ([[George Eads]]) catches up with a suspect ([[Gil Bellows]]) and tests him for [[Gunshot residue|GSR]] which comes back positive so he is arrested. [[D.B. Russell]] ([[Ted Danson]]) enters the house and he notices that the technology seems to follow him and the lights turn on when he walks past them. [[Greg Sanders]] ([[Eric Szmanda]]) tells D.B. that he believes the house is a [[Home automation|smart house]]. While [[Julie Finlay]] ([[Elisabeth Shue]]) is taking crime scene photos, [[Al Robbins]] ([[Robert David Hall]]) gives a brief belief of what he believes happened. When D.B. looks through the suspect's (revealed as the victim's husband Lee Berman) computer he notices a photo of a woman ([[Torrey DeVitto]]) but then the computer crashes. The scene cuts to [[Washington, D.C.]] where a woman (Avery Ryan, [[Patricia Arquette]]} from the [[FBI]] is sitting on the phone demanding a flight to [[Las Vegas]] because the Kitty case is involved in a murder.

At an airfield Avery arrives where a pilot complains about her wanting to stop at Vegas, she then tells the pilot things he doesn't like about himself and he quickly tells her that she can come.

In Las Vegas, Brass is interviewing Berman about his wife's murder. It is shown that Avery is watching the interview, Avery asks [[Conrad Ecklie]] ([[Marc Vann]]) if she can go in and interview. Avery starts to quiz Berman about Kitty. Berman demands his solicitors to leave the room but when Avery tells him that she knows when people are lying he calls his solicitors back in.

D.B., Julie, Nick and [[David Hodges (CSI)|David Hodges]] look for Kitty in the database, Avery explains about the deep web and then gets one of her agents to log into Kitty's website and they use Hodges' name to log in the site. Avery shows them that Kitty is just a chatbot.

In his office, Avery talks to D.B. about the case and requests Finlay to assist her to review the computer. Avery manages to retrieve the data from Berman's computer and they learn that there was a two-way camera on the computer. Avery and Finlay conclude that Berman unknownly made a [[sex tape]]. Avery notices Kitty massaging her jaw and investigates further.

In the morgue, [[David Phillips (CSI)|David Phillips]] ([[David Berman (actor)|David Berman]]) gives D.B. a bullet. while Robbins is performing the [[autopsy]].

[[Morgan Brody]] ([[Elisabeth Harnois]]) tells D.B. that the bullet found doesn't match Berman's bullets. Berman is then released from custody and he walks past the police station reception and sees a woman (also DeVitto) who is identical to Kitty. Avery explains to the woman (whose name is Susan) that she is a person of interest. Susan tells Avery that she is on Friend Agenda. Avery notes to Susan that she has an &quot;idiosyncratic medical condition&quot;.

Avery and Susan work out that Susan's top hit on her profile is the one who created Kitty. Meanwhile, Ecklie tells Berman to stay at the hotel where he learns that Berman doesn't have a dog so Nick takes the dog to Hodges while Greg is briefing how the killer knew the house. The three learn that the killer got a dog to fool the security at the house.

Brass finds the car rented by the killer and he and Nick goto the car where it was empty as a plane flies overhead they realise the killer has fled the country. Nick takes the evidence back to the office and briefs D.B. and Avery. There was a video of the murder where Avery realises that her suspect was never in Las Vegas.

Avery and Nick look at Nebula1's ([[Cheyenne Jackson]]) first profile picture, and learn that he is [[agoraphobic]] and orders in a lot. They then learn that he is in [[St Louis]] due to them being able to make out the [[Gateway Arch]] in the background. When FBI agents raid his house they find computers with Kitty on them all and then Avery realises it is a trap and they lose all evidence.

Avery organises a press conference where Susan tells her story. After the conference Avery is informed that Nebula1 has crashed Susan's profile.

In [[San Diego]], Avery confronts Nebula1, he then attacks Avery and cuts her with his knife. Avery says her codeword and he is then arrested.

'''''Sabhash''''' (English: Bravo) is a Tamil [[thriller film]] directed by [[K. Subash]] featuring [[R. Parthiepan]], [[Divya Unni]] and [[Ranjith (actor)|Ranjith]] which was released  on 1 September 2000. The film was remade in Hindi as ''Vaadaa'' (2005).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rediff.com/movies/2005/jan/07vaada.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

The movie opens with Cheenu ([[R. Parthiepan]]), who is blind, and his good friend Dharan ([[Ranjith (actor)|Ranjith]]) finding out that Cheenu's wife Shanti ([[Divya Unni]]) has died by hanging herself in their house. The police close the case as a suicide. Evidence surfaces which point to Dharan's guilt. But he resolutely maintains that he is innocent while Cheenu too believes his friend.
It keeps the suspense alive successfully first with respect to Ranjith's innocence and then the reason behind the happenings.

``Sabash''. It belongs to the Hollywood genre of films like ``Sleuth'' where two people are pitted against each other. The whole film is about how each tries to outwit the other.

Here, the two persons in focus are Parthiban and Ranjith. Parthiban plays Seenu, a loving husband of Shanti (Divya Unni), while Ranjith plays Dharan, Shanti's ex-lover. Life is going great for Shanti and Seenu when, in an accident, Seenu loses his eyesight. Enters Dharan. And, Shanti commits suicide. But why?

Parthiban seems convinced that his wife has been murdered and all the evidence points towards Dharan. Suddenly one day, Dharan discovers that Seenu is not blind, after all. So then, could Seenu have murdered his wife? Or was it Dharan? Or was it suicide? Why did Seenu pretend to be blind?

==Reception==
''The Hindu'' wrote &quot;The story [..] has several plot twists, some of which are predictable. But in a film that is supposed to be a murder mystery, the badly choreographed song sequences seem to be rude interruptions. Ideally, the film would have worked better if the songs had been cut out and the editing had been tighter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/2000/09/08/stories/09080225.htm&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thiraipadam'' wrote &quot;The director does have a good kernel of an idea for a crime thriller&amp;nbsp;— a genre that is populated by very few memorable entries in tamil cinema. But he fails to build up on the idea to deliver the goods. An erratic tone, misplaced comedy, sloppy editing and intrusive, unimaginative song sequences cut into the promising idea at the heart of the movie and the results, [..] are another weak entry into the thriller genre and sadness at a botched opportunity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thiraipadam.com/cgi-bin/movie_review.pl?id=124&amp;user_name=bbalaji&amp;review_lang=english&amp;lang=english&lt;/ref&gt;
