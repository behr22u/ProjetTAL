==Story==
{{main|List of Kamen Rider W characters}}
Many people live in peace and harmony in {{nihongo4|Futo|風都|Fūto|the &quot;[[Windy City (disambiguation)|Windy City]]&quot;}}, an ecologically-minded and [[windmill|wind-powered]] city. However, this peace is undermined by the [[List of Kamen Rider W characters#Sonozaki Family|Sonozaki Family]], who sell mysterious [[USB flash drive|flash drive]]-like devices called [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] Memories to criminals and other interested parties. These individuals use the Gaia Memories to become [[Dopant (Kamen Rider)|Dopants]], committing crimes with the police force powerless to stop them. To make matters worse, the Gaia Memories can cause their users to go insane, to the point where they could die from using the devices unrestrained. After the death of his [[Kamen Rider Skull|boss]], the self-proclaimed hard-boiled (actually half-boiled) detective Shotaro Hidari works with the mysterious Philip, who possesses a set of purified Gaia Memories, to investigate Dopant-related crimes in Futo. With their Gaia Memories and the Double Driver belts, Shotaro and Philip transform and combine into [[Kamen Rider Double (character)|Kamen Rider Double]] to fight the Dopant menace and keep Futo safe. While joined in their fight by investigator Ryu Terui, who transforms into [[Kamen Rider Accel]], the mystery of Philip's past, his relation to the Sonozaki Family, and their Museum organization are revealed.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvkun809&quot;&gt;''Telebikun'' August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toei.co.jp/tv/w/story/1189003_1613.html|title=仮面ライダーダブル introduction｜東映［テレビ］| accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episodes==
{{main|List of Kamen Rider W episodes}}
All episodes of ''Kamen Rider W'' have two titles: the first indicates a story arc while the second indicates the episode's title. The letter of the [[Latin alphabet]] in the story arc title has a [[double meaning]]: it represents a major character (Kamen Rider, Dopant, or otherwise) that is featured in the arc and another English word that indicates the theme of the arc.

All of ''Double''{{'}}s theme songs have been played as part of the various radio shows, several of which were first heard on the &quot;radio&quot; before being utilized as part of an episode's soundtrack.

Each of these bands is named after a major early 20th century [[hurricane]]: the [[1935 Labor Day hurricane]], the [[1900 Galveston hurricane]], and the [[1919 Florida Keys hurricane]]. The newest group, the [[visual kei]] band Wilma-Sidr, is named after [[Hurricane Wilma]] and [[Cyclone Sidr]].

==Parodies==
Episode 295-A of ''[[Sgt. Frog]]'' titled {{nihongo4|&quot;Keroro, The Two of Us are One Kerororm&quot;|ケロロ 二人が一人ケロロ〜ム! であります|Keroro Futari ga Hitori Kerorōmu! de Arimasu}} features the members of the [[Keroro Platoon]] finding an artifact that allows two of them to combine into a single Keroro, each with new powers. The episode title is based on ''Kamen Rider W''{{'}}s catchphrase and the resultant transformation resembles that of Kamen Rider Double (the characters appear to be split down the middle, with one side being, for example, Keroro and the other Tamama).

'''''Abhilasha''''' ({{lang-te|అభిలాష}}, {{lang-en|Desire}}) is a 1983 [[Cinema of Andhra Pradesh|Telugu film]], directed by [[A. Kodandarami Reddy]] and was produced by [[K.S. Rama Rao]]. It is the film adaptation of [[Yandamuri Veerendranath]]'s novel of the same name. [[Chiranjeevi]], [[Raadhika Sarathkumar| Raadhika]], [[Rao Gopal Rao]], and [[Gollapudi Maruthi Rao]] played vital roles. The super hit music for the movie was scored by [[Ilayaraja]].

The film was remade in Tamil as ''Sattathai Thiruthungal'' with [[Mohan (actor)|Mohan]].

== Plot ==
Struggling lawyer Chiranjeevi ([[Chiranjeevi]]) lives with his roommate ([[Allu Aravind]]) and strives for removing IPC Section 302. The reason behind his determination is his father's death sentence under 302 for rape and murder, which he didn't commit.

Sarvothama Rao ([[Rao Gopal Rao]]), a famous criminal lawyer in that city, sends an invitation to every famous lawyer for a party at his place. By his secretary's mistake, one invitation reaches Chiranjeevi and he gets a chance to meet Sarvothama Rao and express his idea about IPC 302. He also meets Sarvothama Rao's niece Archana ([[Raadhika Sarathkumar]]) at the party and falls in love with her. When their love starts blossoming, Archana has to attend a meeting in another country and she leaves for few days.

During this time [[Chiranjeevi]] comes up with an idea: to plan a fake [[murder]], in which he will implicate himself and receive a death sentence. According to his plan, Sarvothama Rao will show original pictures of the dead body to the governor at the last moment and rescue Chiranjeevi. Then, both intend to file a petition with the Supreme Court against IPC 302. They manage to frame him with the body of a woman, and Chiranjeevi is sentenced to death, just as he planned. In jail, guard Vishnu Sharma (Rallapalli) is surprised to see Chiranjeevi happy before his death. Archana returns from abroad and finds out that Chiranjeevi will be hanged the next day. She goes to meet Chiranjeevi in prison, and he acts like he actually did commit the crime out of lust. Archana does not know Chiranjeevi's plan and leaves in disgust. On the night before Chiranjeevi's hanging, Sarvothama Rao, who is on his way to meet governor to rescue Chiranjeevi, has an accident.

A tense Chiranjeevi reveals to Vishnu Sharma that this was all fake and that he did not kill the woman, pleading for his help. Vishnu Sharma runs to Archana's house to tell her the truth. After a night-long struggle, they manage to get in touch with Sarvothama Rao, who is alive in hospital. They get the original negatives and Chiranjeevi is saved from being hanged.

Sarvothama Rao throws a party to celebrate Chiranjeevi's success and announces Chiranjeevi and Archana's engagement. A drunk (Gollapudi) drags Chiranjeevi out of the party and Archana gets suspicious about their secret talk. She follows him. Meanwhile, Chiranjeevi believes that the dead body of the woman he used did not die a natural death. A postmortem report shows that she was killed by a man with four fingers on one hand. Archana remembers a goon who attacked her on the night she saved Chiranjeevi. Chiranjeevi reveals that he bought the body from that four-fingered goon. It slowly unfolds that the dead woman was Sarvothama Rao's daughter from his extramarital relationship. Sarvothama Rao is arrested and in court the judge sentences him to death. But Chiranjeevi objects. He finds that the death penalty is ridiculous and that it is not a punishment to kill someone. To punish, one must suffer for his/her actions. After a short speech, the judge agrees and instead gives him seven years to prison.

==Production==
After the super success of his horror novels in late 1970's [[Yandamuri Veerendranath]] came up with the novel Abhilasha based on original idea from O.S.R. Murthy. Being a fan of Yandamoori's novels, [[K.S. Rama Rao]] wanted to make his first movie based on this novel. [[K.S. Rama Rao]] until than had been dubbing Tamil movies into Telugu and also distributing movies and involved in publicity for movies as well. He brought together the combination of actor [[Chiranjeevi]], writer [[Yandamuri Veerendranath]], composer [[Ilaiyaraaja]] and director [[A. Kodandarami Reddy]] together for the first time with this movie. This combination later went on to make many successful movies in 1980's.

==Reception==
The movie was a critical and commercial success and became a blockbuster which gave a boost to the careers of all involved with the movie. Ilaiyaraaja's songs became immensely popular and are still played regularly even after 3 decades. The movie was praised for sticking with the basic plot line of the novel which had a very unique story and had already become a huge success.

'''''Ek Ruka Hua Faisla''''' (English: ''A Pending Decision'') is a 1986 Indian [[bollywood]] [[courtroom drama]] film, directed by [[Basu Chatterjee]]. It is a [[remake]] of the [[Golden Bear]] winning, American motion picture ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'' (1957), which was directed by [[Sidney Lumet]], the film in turn was an adaptation from a [[Twelve Angry Men (Westinghouse Studio One)|teleplay of the same name]] by [[Reginald Rose]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; 27 February 1957, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews|Harrison's Reports]]'' film review; 2 March 1957, page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story begins in a courtroom where a teenage boy from a city slum is on trial for stabbing his father to death. Final closing arguments have been presented, and the judge then instructs the jury to decide whether the boy is guilty of murder which carries a mandatory death sentence. Once inside the Jury discussion room, it is immediately apparent that all jurors with the sole exception of Juror Number 8 (K.K. Raina) have already decided that the boy is guilty, and that they plan to return their verdict quickly, without taking time for discussion. His vote annoys the other jurors.

The rest of the film centers around the jury's difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict. While several of the jurors harbor personal prejudices, Juror 8 maintains that the evidence presented in the case is circumstantial, and that the boy deserves a fair deliberation. He calls into question the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the rarity of the murder weapon (a common pocketknife, of which he has an identical copy), and the overall questionable circumstances (including the fact that an elevated train was passing by at the time of the murder). He further argues that he cannot in good conscience vote &quot;guilty&quot; when he feels there is reasonable doubt of the boy's guilt and slowly convinces each juror about the same by his logical findings around each piece of evidence.

At the end, the only remaining juror with a guilty vote is Juror 3. A long argument with Juror 8 culminates in 3 revealing that he had had a poor relationship with his own son, and his anger over this fact is the main reason he wants the defendant to be guilty. Juror 3 loses his temper and tears up a photo of himself and his son, then suddenly breaks down crying and changes his vote to &quot;not guilty&quot;, making the vote unanimous.

After [[Emily Kaldwin|Empress Emily Kaldwin]] is deposed by the witch Delilah Copperspoon, the player may choose between playing as either Emily or her Royal Protector and father [[Corvo Attano]] as they attempt to reclaim the throne. Both Emily and Corvo employ their own array of supernatural abilities, though the player can alternatively decide to forfeit these abilities altogether. There is a multitude of ways to complete missions, from stealth to purposeful violent conflict, navigated through a [[Glossary of video game terms#Sandbox game|sandbox]] environment.

Ideas for ''Dishonored 2'' began while developing the downloadable content of its predecessor, which spawned the decision to create a voice for Corvo Attano after being a silent character in the first installment. The advancement of the timeline was brought about once Emily Kaldwin, only a child in ''Dishonored'', was first proposed as a playable character. The game's aesthetic was influenced by paintings and sculptures. Set in the new fictional city of Karnaca, its history was invented over the course of one year. The city itself was based on [[southern Europe]]an countries like [[Greece]], [[Italy]], and [[Spain]], drawing on the architecture, fashion, and technologies of 1851.

''Dishonored 2'' was released to a positive reception. Praised were the improvements made since the first game: the more challenging stealth, the adaptability of Emily and Corvo's abilities to both play styles, the art direction, the creative design of individual missions, the realization of the game's world as well as the replay-value and the artificial intelligence. Criticism was directed at the lack of focus of the overarching narrative. Aside from this, technical blunders as well as issues with the PC version were received unfavorably. ''Dishonored 2'' won the award for Best Action/Adventure Game at [[The Game Awards 2016]] and for Costume Design at the 2017 [[National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers|NAVGTR Awards]].

== Gameplay ==
''Dishonored 2'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[stealth game]] played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. After playing as [[Emily Kaldwin|Empress Emily Kaldwin]] during the prologue, players may decide to play either as Emily or as [[Corvo Attano]] (the protagonist from [[Dishonored|the previous game]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;a long day in dunwall&quot; /&gt; Side missions unlock alternate methods of assassination, non-lethal approaches and paths to navigate the main mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;a long day in dunwall&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;edge of the world&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;the good doctor&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;a crack in the slab&quot; /&gt; Both characters wield [[sword]]s, [[pistol]]s, [[crossbow]]s, a retractable [[blade]], [[grenade]]s and [[Land mine|mine]]s—all of which are upgradable.&lt;ref name=&quot;edge of the world&quot; /&gt; Upgrades may be purchased at black market shops found throughout the levels, and blueprints scattered across levels unlock new potential upgrades (in New Game Plus playthroughs, blueprints already acquired are converted into additional coin). Coin is required to buy these upgrades, which again may be found throughout a level or gained from other collectibles, like stealing paintings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collectibles&quot; /&gt; Players can choose whether to play stealthily or not, and can finish the game without taking a life.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN: Dish&quot; /&gt; Health elixirs and food consumables will restore health, while mana elixirs replenish mana.&lt;ref name=&quot;edge of the world&quot; /&gt;

Enemy detection works on line-of-sight, with players being able to use cover or high areas out of enemies' cones of vision to stay undetected.&lt;ref name=&quot;KotakuTips&quot; /&gt; Darkness can aid the player in staying hidden, but it is only effective at a distance.&lt;ref name=&quot;at a distance&quot; /&gt; Enemy alert meters and musical cues let the player know if they've been spotted. Noise will cause enemies to go to investigate, including noise made by broken bottles or the player striking a sword against the wall; this may be used deliberately to lure guards into traps or disrupt their patrol route.&lt;ref name=&quot;KotakuTips&quot; /&gt; Players can look through keyholes to help them survey a room before entering, and can lean to look from cover without fully exposing themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;KotakuTips&quot; /&gt; The player is now able to be detected if they peer out from behind a wall for too long, a feature not seen in ''Dishonored''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIGameplay&quot; /&gt; To avoid detection, the player may choke people out or have their throat slit. Bodies can be carried away and concealed. Alarms can be disabled to assure that enemies are not alerted to the player's presence.&lt;ref name=&quot;edge of the world&quot; /&gt; Walls of Light, barriers powered by wind or whale oil, are subject to have their power turned off or be rewired so that only enemies are killed by going through them. Whale oil canisters explode on harsh impact, and can be thrown at enemies to that end.&lt;ref name=&quot;edge of the world&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;the clockwork mansion&quot; /&gt;

''Dishonored 2'' introduces non-lethal combat moves to throw people off-balance or knock someone unconscious—choke-holds, blocks, pushes, kicks, crouch-slides, drops from high up, sleep darts, stun mines, and various supernatural abilities—and features the chaos system used in the first game.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCGPrev&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM Feature&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;edge of the world&quot; /&gt; The player gains chaos by killing characters, representative of the player destabilizing the world. The game adds a new element to the system where, at the start of a mission, random non-player characters are procedurally assigned one of three states: sympathetic, guilty, and murderous. Killing a &quot;sympathetic&quot; person gives the player more chaos than killing others, while in contrast killing a murderous character gives the player a lesser amount.&lt;ref name=&quot;Assassin Abilities&quot; /&gt; The amount of chaos accrued affects the dialog used by Emily and Corvo&lt;ref name=&quot;PCGPrev&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM Feature&quot; /&gt; and the quantity of enemies present in each given level.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvey answers&quot; /&gt; Further, insects called bloodflies make nests in corpses; therefore if many people are killed, there will be an increase in bloodflies. Loot can be found in the nests which, if destroyed, can be obtained. The bloodflies similarly encourage the player to hide bodies from them while on a mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;GZ Hide&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GS Journey&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;edge of the world&quot; /&gt; Each level in the game is intended to have a unique theme, in either fiction or [[game mechanic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GM Feature&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GS Journey&quot; /&gt; In one level, the player is confronted with two factions each with their own assassination target, and may use the level's reoccurring dust storms for cover.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM Feature&quot; /&gt; In another, time distortion is introduced as the player traverses an abandoned mansion in ruins. The player is given a device that lets them glimpse three years into the past, where the mansion is still occupied and guards roam, and can shift back and forth between the two points in time.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPS Time&quot; /&gt;

=== Abilities and powers ===
[[File:Dishonored 2 Corvo vs Emily Gameplay.webm|thumb|left|The difference in gameplay between Emily and Corvo]]

As in the first game, the player has access to supernatural powers. These powers are optional and may be rejected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flesh and steel&quot; /&gt; Independently from whether these supernatural powers are rejected or not, the player receives a heart item which aids in the discovery of bonecharms and runes; these provide passive perks and skill points, respectively; if the powers are not accepted, runes are converted into additional coins.&lt;ref name=&quot;wind&quot; /&gt; The heart also reveals whether those the player comes across are sympathetic, guilty or murderous.&lt;ref name=&quot;edge of the world&quot; /&gt; Unlike the first game, the upgrading system was changed to a [[skill tree]] with multiple paths and more possible upgrades; a power may have a lethal or non-lethal upgrade.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIGameplay&quot; /&gt; Each character has unique powers. &quot;Dark Vision&quot;, the power that more easily identifies the player's surroundings, including where an enemy directs their gaze, is available to both.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIPowers3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;edge of the world&quot; /&gt; Another skill tree, applied to both playable characters, unlock more passive abilities which do not consume mana, such as the ability to run faster and jump higher, or the ability to craft bonecharms.&lt;ref name=&quot;edge of the world&quot; /&gt;

Corvo retains many of the powers available in the first game, though his progress in them has been reset. &quot;Blink&quot; still teleports him to a chosen location, but in addition can be upgraded  to freeze time or impart damage on impact with the momentum gained from teleportation. Corvo may summon rats with &quot;Devouring Swarm&quot; to clear dead bodies before bloodflies lay eggs in them. While its original use allowed Corvo to possess animals and humans, &quot;Possession&quot; is enhanced to take control of dead bodies as well as multiple hosts in succession. &quot;Bend Time&quot; can be used to slow down time, circumventing dangerous checkpoints or reaching enemies unobserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIPowers3&quot; /&gt; The ability known as &quot;Windblast&quot; enables Corvo to summon a blast of wind that can deflect projectiles and push enemies off ledges.&lt;ref name=&quot;wind&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;blast&quot; /&gt; Emily has powers new to the series, including &quot;Far Reach&quot;, which allows her to pull objects and enemies toward her&lt;ref name=&quot;GIConcept&quot; /&gt; and travel without physical movement by clasping onto something to propel herself forward. She can use &quot;Mesmerize&quot; to distract her enemies, moving them into a state of sedation. &quot;Domino&quot; permits Emily to connect several of her enemies together so that they share the same outcome. With &quot;Shadow Walk&quot;, she is turned into a shadowy cloud that moves swiftly and changes tangibility at will. &quot;Doppelganger&quot; conjures a clone of Emily in order to misdirect her opponents, and can work alongside &quot;Domino&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIPowers&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GIPowers2&quot; /&gt;

== Synopsis ==

===Setting===
While players begin and end the game in Dunwall, much of the story takes place in the coastal city of Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos that lies along the southern region of the Empire of the Isles, whose chief exports include [[silver]]. Unlike Dunwall, which relied on whale oil for power, Karnaca is powered by [[wind turbine]]s fed by currents generated by a cleft mountain along the city's borders, though the winds that blow over and into the city cause it to be rife with [[dust storm]]s, most notably within its mining district which led it to be known as the &quot;Dust District&quot;. At the time the game begins, two factions, the Howlers and Overseers, engage in violent conflict within the district, with the Howlers seeking to oppose the new Duke and his government following the passing of its previous Duke, leading to the Grand Serkonan Guard, Karnaca's law enforcement and military, erecting defensive barriers called Walls of Light in response to the disarray.&lt;ref name=&quot;jewel&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCGPrev2&quot; /&gt;

===Characters===
[[File:Dishonored 2 - Corvo &amp; Emily - Paris Games Week 2016.jpg|thumb|Actors portraying Corvo and Emily at [[Paris Games Week]] 2016]]
The main characters of ''Dishonored 2'' that the player can control are Corvo Attano (Stephen Russell), a former bodyguard turned assassin and the main character of ''[[Dishonored]]''; and Emily Kaldwin ([[Erica Luttrell]]), the former Empress of Dunwall. The game's main antagonists include Luca Abele ([[Vincent D'Onofrio]]), the new duke of Serkonos following the passing of his father Theodanis; and Delilah Copperspoon ([[Erin Cottrell]]), a witch and the antagonist of the previous game's DLC packs, ''The Knife of Dunwall'' and ''The Brigmore Witches'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Usurper&quot; /&gt; as well as being the half-sister of Emily's deceased mother; promotional material from the special collector's edition of the game references her as &quot;Delilah Kaldwin&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillier&quot; /&gt;

Other characters in the game include: Meagan Foster ([[Rosario Dawson]]){{mdash}}the captain of the Dreadful Wale; Paolo ([[Pedro Pascal]]){{mdash}}leader of the Howler Gang; Mindy Blanchard (Betsy Moore){{mdash}}Paolo's second-in-command; Mortimer Ramsey ([[Sam Rockwell]]){{mdash}}a corrupt officer of the Dunwall City Watch; Liam Byrne ([[Jamie Hector]]){{mdash}}the Vice Overseer of Karnaca who opposes the Howlers; Anton Sokolov ([[Roger L. Jackson]]){{mdash}}Dunwall's genius inventor; [[The Outsider (Dishonored)|the Outsider]] ([[Robin Lord Taylor]]){{mdash}}the representational figure of the Void, an alternate dimension that grants supernatural abilities; and Jessamine Kaldwin ([[April Stewart]]){{mdash}}Emily Kaldwin's mother, whose spirit was trapped in The Heart.&lt;ref name=&quot;edge of the world&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VoiceGIMay15&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;the heart&quot; /&gt;

===Plot===
Fifteen years after Corvo Attano restored Emily Kaldwin to the throne following the assassination of her mother, Dunwall has prospered under her reign. However, a serial killer by the name of the &quot;Crown Killer&quot; has been brutally murdering Emily's enemies, leading many to believe that Emily and Corvo are responsible. During a ceremony in remembrance of Jessamine Kaldwin's assassination, Duke Luca Abele of Serkonos arrives with the witch Delilah Copperspoon, who claims to be Jessamine's older half-sister and the true heir to the throne. The Duke's men then attack, killing Emily's loyal subjects. At this point, the player chooses whether to continue as Emily or Corvo. Depending on the player's choice, the other character will be turned to stone. The player is able to escape to the Dunwall docks, where Meagan Foster is waiting. Meagan was sent by Anton Sokolov to warn Emily and Corvo about the Duke's coup. They set sail for Karnaca, where Delilah began her rise to power. During the voyage, the player is visited by the Outsider, who offers them supernatural powers and instructs them to stop Delilah.&lt;ref name=&quot;a long day in dunwall&quot; /&gt;

Upon arriving in Karnaca, the player is tasked with rescuing Sokolov, who was kidnapped by the Crown Killer.&lt;ref name=&quot;edge of the world&quot; /&gt; Infiltrating Addermire Institute, where the Crown Killer is reportedly hiding out, the player discovers that the Crown Killer is in fact the alter ego of Karnaca's Chief Alchemist, Alexandria Hypatia ([[Jessica Straus]]). Hypatia accidentally created the Crown Killer persona when she tested an experimental serum on herself, and the Duke exploited her by using the Crown Killer to frame Emily. The player has the choice of either killing her or curing her condition. After investigating Addermire, it is made known that Sokolov was imprisoned by Kirin Jindosh ([[John Gegenhuber]]), the Duke's Grand Inventor and creator of the clockwork soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;the good doctor&quot; /&gt; The player enters Jindosh's Clockwork Mansion, kills him or performs an electrical lobotomy on him thus stripping him of his intellect, and frees Sokolov.&lt;ref name=&quot;the clockwork mansion&quot; /&gt; Sokolov then directs the player to eliminate Breanna Ashworth ([[Melendy Britt]]), the curator of the Royal Conservatory and witch working for Delilah. The player enters the Royal Conservatory and discovers that after Delilah's defeat at the hands of Daud, who was responsible for assassinating Emily's mother, it was Ashworth who brought Delilah back from the Void. Ashworth is eliminated by way of a fatal attack or having her powers removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;the royal conservatory&quot; /&gt;

With Delilah being too powerful to defeat by normal means, Sokolov suggests the player investigate the home of mining magnate Aramis Stilton ([[Richard Cansino]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;dust district&quot; /&gt; Upon entering Stilton's mansion, the player discovers that he had gone insane after witnessing Delilah's resurrection. With the aid of a timepiece granted by the Outsider, the player travels back in time and observes the Duke, Jindosh, and Ashworth pull Delilah from the Void. Afterwards, Delilah siphons part of her soul into a statue, effectively making her immortal.&lt;ref name=&quot;a crack in the slab&quot; /&gt; The player invades the Duke's palace to eliminate him and retrieve Delilah's soul. After either killing the Duke or working with his body double to depose him, the player finds the statue and extracts Delilah's soul.&lt;ref name=&quot;the grand palace&quot; /&gt; With Delilah's soul in hand, the player returns to Dunwall for a final confrontation with Delilah. After reuniting Delilah with her soul, the player may choose to kill Delilah or trick her into trapping herself inside her own painting.&lt;ref name=&quot;death to the empress&quot; /&gt;

==== Endings ====
There are multiple endings based on whether the player caused high chaos by indiscriminate murder, or achieved low chaos by refraining from taking lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;death to the empress&quot; /&gt;

In the High Chaos ending, the player is faced with the choice of freeing Emily / Corvo from petrification or leaving them that way forever. If Emily is not left in stone, she becomes a vengeful empress and brutally purges Delilah's supporters, with Corvo by her side in one form or another. If Corvo leaves Emily petrified, he takes the throne for himself and becomes a brutal tyrant known as Emperor Corvo &quot;the Black&quot;. Meanwhile, Karnaca is either ruled by a new tyrant or collapses completely into anarchy and, if still alive, Sokolov becomes a broken man after having borne witness to the perversion of his work and is exiled to his home country. In the Low Chaos ending, the player frees Emily / Corvo from their imprisonment. A council of representatives takes charge in Karnaca and brings the city back from the brink. Emily becomes a fair and just ruler, reuniting the Empire with Corvo by her side. Sokolov, proud to see his work used for good, returns to his home country. In either ending, if Meagan – who is revealed to be Billie Lurk – survives, she leaves to search for Daud.&lt;ref name=&quot;death to the empress&quot; /&gt;

== Development ==
''Dishonored 2'' was developed by [[Arkane Studios]] and published by [[Bethesda Softworks]]. After having co-directed the first game,&lt;ref name=&quot;Polygon: reveal&quot; /&gt; [[Harvey Smith (game designer)|Harvey Smith]] took on the reins as director of ''Dishonored 2''.&lt;ref name=&quot;director 2&quot; /&gt; Though the first ''Dishonored'' was developed by both Arkane teams in Lyon, France and Austin, United States, its sequel was developed largely solely in Lyon as Arkane Studios Austin were focused on developing 2017's ''[[Prey (2017 video game)|Prey]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;five&quot; /&gt; Both studios collaborated on the game, and playtested each other's builds.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIGameplay&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;five&quot; /&gt; The game runs on Arkane's internal &quot;Void&quot; engine, as opposed to [[Unreal Engine 3]] that was previously used in ''[[Dishonored]]''. The Void engine is based on [[id Tech 5]],{{#tag:ref|While some sources describe Void as being based on [[id Tech 6]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gamereactor Interview&quot; /&gt; most instead say id Tech 5.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCGPrev&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;five&quot; /&gt;|group=nb}} though the majority of the original engine was rewritten.&lt;ref name=&quot;five&quot; /&gt; Arkane removed unneeded elements from the engine like the mini open world and overhauled the graphics. The new engine is intended to improve in-game lighting and post-processing to help the game's visuals,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCGPrev&quot; /&gt; and allows the game to visualize [[subsurface scattering]].&lt;ref name=&quot;VG247 Interview&quot; /&gt;

''Dishonored'' was not developed with a sequel in mind, but ideas for one began to emerge during the development of its downloadable content. Harvey Smith called the decision to play as Emily as intuitive at the start, with Emily having been a child in the original game.&lt;ref name=&quot;EG Interview&quot; /&gt; The impact that Emily had on players in ''Dishonored'', which changed how the game was being played, made the developer decide to continue her story and give her more depth in ''Dishonored 2''.&lt;ref name=&quot;her story&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;more depth&quot; /&gt; Although this meant moving the timeline along, Arkane did not want to go too far for fear of losing the series' [[gaslamp fantasy]] / [[steampunk]] vibe.&lt;ref name=&quot;EG Interview&quot; /&gt; The choice to include Corvo as an alternate player character was itself a later decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;VG247 Interview&quot; /&gt; 

In contrast to the first game, it was decided that both Emily Kaldwin and Corvo Attano should be voiced in ''Dishonored 2''.&lt;ref name=&quot;VoiceGIMay15&quot; /&gt; The developers had previously experimented with a voiced player character with the assassin Daud in two pieces of ''Dishonored''{{'}}s [[downloadable content]], ''The Knife of Dunwall'' and ''The Brigmore Witches''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM Feature&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GS Voiced&quot; /&gt; Voiced player characters allowed the developers to draw attention to things on-screen via dialogue, and Arkane found them better at making players more emotionally invested.&lt;ref name=&quot;GS Voiced&quot; /&gt; As Corvo had been a silent character in the first game, Arkane wanted to avoid going against any broad assumptions a player may have made about his character while also giving him a more assertive personality, which Smith remarked as an increased challenge for the writers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corvo Reacquainted&quot; /&gt; Originally, the player was to have access to all the powers regardless of what character was chosen. However, instead the team chose to limit them, and have the character's powers &quot;reflect their lives or their time in the world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Assassin Abilities&quot; /&gt;

Arkane was influenced by some criticisms of the first ''Dishonored''.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCG Interview&quot; /&gt; Although the difficulty was not considered a major problem, a sizeable number of players had complained the first was too easy, and thus the harder difficulty settings were reworked.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIGameplay&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EG Interview&quot; /&gt; The chaos system of ''Dishonored'', considered as merely a binary [[Ersatz good|ersatz]] meter, was intended to have more depth in the sequel.&lt;ref name=&quot;ersatz&quot; /&gt; The altered chaos system, where different individuals grant varying amounts of chaos, was implemented due to how many players used the Heart in the original game. As the Heart would reveal secrets about whomever it was pointed at, players would use it to decide which NPCs to kill and which to leave be or spare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Assassin Abilities&quot; /&gt; Also intended to yield additional improvements was the upgrade system, which would for the first time level up based on a skill tree. Bonecharms were made into craftable items, with 400,000 possible combinations available.&lt;ref name=&quot;boned charms&quot; /&gt; While taking into account the intricacies of how supernatural abilities would be used, designers faced increased difficulty in relation to the play-style where the game is traversed in their absence, noting the accommodation of the play-style in a way that would not cancel out the other as a challenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;48c3nc3&quot; /&gt;

As Arkane's Austin studio had left to work on ''Prey'', Arkane Studios Lyon had to rebuild the AI team and begin work on the AI &quot;from scratch&quot;. In addition to their own individual AIs, the guards in the game respond to a master AI that assigns them roles and helps them react to and work with each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI&quot; /&gt;

With ''Dishonored 2'', developers wanted to make the game's characters more representative.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvey answers&quot; /&gt; Arkane tried to give more key roles to non-white characters both to match the &quot;melting pot&quot; nature of the Empire and create a realistic world, and to ensure any potential player could find themselves reflected in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvey answers&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Diversity&quot; /&gt; Elsewhere, characters exist who are not heterosexual, though developers wished this to feel a natural part of the world rather than &quot;draw[ing] a big sign&quot; around them. Emily's sexuality itself is deliberately never specified in order to allow for players to impose their own interpretations.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvey answers&quot; /&gt; The first ''Dishonored'' had received some criticisms about giving women limited types of roles. From ''Dishonored''{{'}}s downloadable content onwards, Arkane attempted to address these concerns and reach a more &quot;plausible balance&quot; in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dishonored Women&quot; /&gt; This trend continued for ''Dishonored 2'' which has women in a wider range of roles, including as guards.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCGPrev&quot; /&gt;

=== Art, level design and setting ===
[[File:Karnaca.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|''Dishonored 2'' takes place in the [[southern Europe]]-inspired Karnaca. Its buildings are often flat-roofed, and the game features a vertical element less emphasized in the original ''Dishonored''.]]
Sébastien Mitton, who acted as art director on the first game,&lt;ref name=&quot;mittens&quot; /&gt; returned to the position for ''Dishonored 2''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIConcept&quot; /&gt; Viktor Antonov, who also helped conceive of ''Dishonored''{{'}}s &quot;painterly&quot; look, had moved on as a general creative consultant for Bethesda and thus was less involved in the art of ''Dishonored 2''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GI issue&quot; /&gt; Arkane drew on paintings and sculptures for the art design, and had Lucie Minne mold several clay busts.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIConcept&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Museum&quot; /&gt; The game begins and ends in the city of Dunwall, the setting of the first game, with most of the game taking place in Karnaca, &quot;the jewel of the south&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM Feature&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnaca&quot; /&gt; The change in setting in part was out of a desire to show another corner of the series' Empire. On using both settings, Harvey Smith commented that Arkane felt &quot;we need to start it at home ... and then venture out into an exotic place and come back&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM Feature&quot; /&gt; Mitton wanted ''Dishonored 2'' to be a visual &quot;journey to a new city&quot;, though keeping the same sensibility of the first game and elements like [[oppression]], [[disease]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], and decay.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCGPrev&quot; /&gt;

The history of Karnaca reportedly took approximately a year to create. After the creation of the setting's basic outline, the team focused on developing ideas that were inspired from inside the game, rather than from the outside world.&lt;ref name=&quot;French History&quot; /&gt; Arkane had [[anthropology]] and [[politics]] in mind when creating the land's history, looking upon the first settlers of the region, the influence of foreign powers taking up residence there, and the different &quot;tides of culture&quot; that shaped the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;GI issue&quot; /&gt; An attempt was made to have the game feature various different types of architecture, to reflect these various waves of settlers. The Arkane team worked with [[industrial designer]]s and [[architect]]s in creating Karnaca.&lt;ref name=&quot;French History&quot;/&gt;

Based on [[southern Europe]] countries like [[Greece]], [[Italy]] and [[Spain]], Karnaca is warmer and sunnier than Dunwall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnaca&quot; /&gt; Reference photos were used from a variety of places to help design the city, including [[Cuba]], [[Lyon]] and [[Malibu, California]]. The buildings in Karnaca frequently have flat roofs and more ornate windows.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIConcept&quot; /&gt; Photography from the 1920s was examined in order to help build a setting with a historical disposition, using reference websites like [[Shorpy.com]] and looking at the work of [[Agustín Casasola]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GIConcept&quot; /&gt; Whereas ''Dishonored'' was largely built on the real world of 1837, ''Dishonored 2'' draws ideas from &quot;the architectural forms, popular fashions, and far-out technologies&quot; of 1851.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM Feature&quot; /&gt; Arkane tried to take architectural concerns into account, and considered the effect the wind would have on the way the city developed, with energy being generated by wind turbines.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCGPrev&quot; /&gt; [[Level design]]ers and level architects collaborated throughout the entire production as locations were built.&lt;ref name=&quot;architect&quot; /&gt; In making Karnaca, a style of [[Art Nouveau]] was applied.&lt;ref name=&quot;art nouveau&quot; /&gt;

The developers intended to depict Karnaca as grounded environment to help the city seem as though it could exist in reality.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIConcept&quot; /&gt; Arkane wished to avoid what one member dubbed &quot;the ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' effect&quot;—wherein man-sized vents were placed wherever the game designers felt, often in nonsensical places.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCG Interview&quot; /&gt; The team tried to reflect practicalities of everyday life; for instance, a building would have to have some kind of toilet and a guard's placement should make in-world sense.&lt;ref name=&quot;French History&quot; /&gt; Colonies in places such as [[Australia]], [[India]] and [[Africa]] were investigated to comprehend the transition of people adapting from the cold climate of Dunwall to areas with a warmer constitution like Karnaca.&lt;ref name=&quot;art nouveau&quot; /&gt;

Designing the in-game [[propaganda]], they studied its use in history, finding the same pattern of elements reappearing throughout the centuries. In place of the militarily inspired propaganda of the first game, ''Dishonored 2'' would employ a subtler approach; lavish posters for invariably canceled enterprises meant to aid the people of Serkonos were made to exhibit the nature of tyranny as practised by the Duke of Serkonos and his government. To further detail the world, the narration team would come up with fictitious products and brand names and make advertisements of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;product propaganda&quot; /&gt;

The game was formally announced during Bethesda's [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015]] press conference by ''Dishonored'' co-directors [[Raphaël Colantonio]] and Harvey Smith,&lt;ref name=&quot;Polygon: reveal&quot; /&gt; but was leaked the night before during a rehearsal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurogamer: leak&quot; /&gt; Lucie Minne's clay models, along with other ''Dishonored'' art, were featured on display at [[Art Ludique]] in an exhibit focused on French video games.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIConcept&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Museum&quot; /&gt; ''Dishonored 2'' appeared again at [[E3 2016]]. An image for the game by Sergei Kolesov was featured as part of the 2016 Into the Pixel collection.&lt;ref name=&quot;pixel kolesov&quot; /&gt; It was [[released to manufacturing]] on 1 November 2016&lt;ref name=&quot;golden 1&quot; /&gt; and made available on 11 November 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;Release Date&quot; /&gt; The PC version was [[Tamper resistance|tamper-protected]] by anti-piracy software [[Denuvo]],&lt;ref name=&quot;denuvo&quot; /&gt; which was cracked in June 2017 by hacker group SteamPunks.&lt;ref name=&quot;cracked&quot; /&gt;

Preordering ''Dishonored 2'' granted players access to the full game a day early.&lt;ref name=&quot;Early&quot; /&gt; Bethesda announced a special collector's edition of the game as a pre-order on their online store. The collector's edition included a 13.5 inch replica of Corvo Attano's signature mask, a zinc alloy replica of Emily Kaldwin's ring, a Delilah Kaldwin propaganda poster and a metal collector's edition case for the game disc and manual. Digital bonuses were also included in the form of the Digital Imperial Assassin's Pack, which included additional in-game content. Pre-orders for console versions of the collector's edition came with a copy of ''[[Dishonored#Release|Dishonored: Definitive Edition]]'', a remastered version of the first game for the eighth generation of consoles with all downloadable content included.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillier&quot; /&gt;

In May 2016, Bethesda announced a  ''Dishonored'' tie-in comic miniseries and novel trilogy. The comic mini-series, published by [[Titan Comics]] and written by [[Gordon Rennie]] with art by Andrea Olimpieri and Marcelo Maiolo, consists of four issues, the first of which was published in August 2016. The three official tie-in novels are published by [[Titan Books]], the first of which, ''The Corroded Man'', written by [[Adam Christopher]], was published in September 2016, with the second and third volumes following in 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;TieIn&quot; /&gt; In addition, a [[Dark Horse Comics]]-created artbook, ''The Art of Dishonored 2'', was announced, launching on the same date as the game. An art contest was held over social media—from 28 June to 17 July 2016—with five winning participants being featured in the book.&lt;ref name=&quot;Art Book&quot; /&gt; A live-action trailer was released a month prior to its release.&lt;ref name=&quot;take action&quot; /&gt;

''Dishonored 2'' received later updates. A [[New Game Plus]] mode was made available on 19 December 2016, which also allows the player access to both protagonists' powers in a single playthrough. Customizable difficulty settings along with a mission-select option were postponed to 23 January 2017 for all platforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;this update&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;postpwned&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mission-select&quot; /&gt; A standalone expansion, ''[[Dishonored: Death of the Outsider]]'', was released on 15 September 2017. It follows Billie Lurk and Daud the assassin as they embark on a mission to kill the Outsider.&lt;ref name=&quot;death of the outsider&quot; /&gt;

==Reception==

===Pre-release===
[[Emily Kaldwin]], and her reveal as player character at E3 2015, drew attention pre-release. [[GamesRadar]] called it one of the event's biggest surprises, noting the rarity of female protagonists.&lt;ref name=&quot;female protagonists&quot; /&gt; Both [[GameSpot]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented on the prominence of female player characters in 2015's E3 expo.&lt;ref name=&quot;e3 3xpo&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;twentyfifteen&quot; /&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' called her one of ten &quot;most promising&quot; new characters revealed at the expo.&lt;ref name=&quot;one of ten&quot; /&gt; The game's appearance at E3 2016 gained accolades. ''[[IGN]]'' awarded it &quot;Best Xbox One Game&quot;, and it was nominated &quot;Game of the Show&quot;, &quot;Best PlayStation 4 Game&quot;, &quot;Best Action Game&quot;, &quot;Best Trailer&quot;, and &quot;Best PC Game&quot;, being the runner-up to the last of which.&lt;ref name=&quot;e3 ign&quot; /&gt;

''Dishonored 2'' was nominated for &quot;Best of Show&quot;, &quot;Best Console Game&quot;, &quot;Best PC Game&quot; and &quot;Best Action/Adventure Game&quot; at the [[Game Critics Awards]].&lt;ref name=&quot;g4me critics 4w4rds&quot; /&gt; ''Game Informer'' awarded the game &quot;Best Multiplatform Game&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;game awarder&quot; /&gt; ''PC Gamer'' gave the game &quot;Best of Show&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;best of show&quot; /&gt; ''[[Eurogamer]]'' selected the game as one of the five best games at E3, highlighting the time-manipulating level and commenting &quot;it's hard to imagine there'll be any game as intricate released this year, nor one quite so imaginative&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;quite so&quot; /&gt;

''Dishonored 2'' received generally favorable reviews according to [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MCPC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MCPS4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MCXONE&quot; /&gt; On its release, PC players reported issues with performance such as loss of [[frame rate]] and [[display resolution]], and [[Crash (computing)|system crashes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kotaku reception&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vg247 reception&quot; /&gt; Three patches for the PC version were released to remedy the problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;escapist reception&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;remedy&quot; /&gt; The levels Clockwork Mansion and A Crack in the Slab were singled out to considerable praise.&lt;ref name=&quot;GI&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCGUS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;clockwork club&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;clocktaku&quot; /&gt; The game has been the recipient of over one hundred Best of 2016 awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;recipient&quot; /&gt;

Chris Carter of [[Destructoid]] considered the stealth approach &quot;glorious&quot;; the heart item one of his favorite ways to be exposed to further content; the puzzles and traversal challenges demanding; and the task of becoming a better assassin rewarding. The only complaints concerned shortcomings in [[frame rate]] capabilities on the [[Xbox One]] console, &quot;stilted voice acting and script issues, despite the compelling narrative&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Destruct&quot; /&gt; [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'s Nick Plessas wrote that ''Dishonored 2'' &quot;[recreates] many of the positive experiences from the previous instalment, but [requires] much greater effort on the part of the player this time around to achieve it&quot;. According to Plessas, the game's emotional substance was derived from the player character as coupled with the choices and their consequences to the story, though he was moved significantly more by the &quot;smaller moments&quot; of the game than the finale.&lt;ref name=&quot;EGM&quot; /&gt;

Writing for ''Game Informer'', Matt Bertz thought the balance between low-chaos and high-chaos play styles held an improved competence from the original game and that each approach availed thought-provoking scenarios to be solved. Each character's abilities were praised as &quot;equally useful&quot;. Bertz disparaged the main story beats however, calling them &quot;rushed and underdeveloped&quot;, whilst lauding the environmental storytelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;GI&quot; /&gt; James Kozanitis at [[Game Revolution]] enjoyed playing as Emily Kaldwin the most and said that, because some elements from ''Dishonored'' had returned, Emily infused a fresh perspective into the overall experience. Kozanitis favored the stealthier approach, which was said to better accommodate side quests—opined as the chief incentive for playing ''Dishonored 2''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameRev&quot; /&gt; ''GameSpot''{{'}}s Scott Butterworth was satisfied with the use of weapons and observed that the sophisticated behavior patterns of the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence (AI)]] rendered into &quot;fun&quot; experimentation, especially for stealth employment. The lack of increasing challenges was subject to criticism, with Butterworth lamenting the &quot;underutilized&quot; new enemies; the plot met charges of reproval for the same reason. Conversely, one quest involving time manipulation was declared a &quot;masterpiece unto itself&quot; and another in a [[clockwork]]-driven mansion was labeled as &quot;mind-bending&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSpot&quot; /&gt;

Lucas Sullivan of ''GamesRadar'' complimented its [[sense of place]], supernatural abilities and execution, but disapproved of the character development and constraint of a number of mechanics that were otherwise &quot;brilliant&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GRadar&quot; /&gt; ''GamesRadar'' remarked in the days following that the Clockwork Mansion mission exemplified the best of Arkane Studios' &quot;rich, intricate level design&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;clockwork radar&quot; /&gt; ''IGN''{{'}}s Lucy O'Brien felt the decision to allocate powers and story details between the two player characters was &quot;smart&quot;, echoing the view that the characters' abilities were &quot;excellently&quot; adaptable to both play styles. She commended the level design for distinguishing each level in terms of providing unique gameplay mechanics and expressed admiration for the game world's &quot;gorgeous, painterly aesthetic&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot; /&gt; Phil Savage, writing for ''PC Gamer'', stated that &quot;At its worst, it offers a similar experience to its predecessor, which is to say, it offers tens of hours of extraordinary first-person stealth and action&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCGUS&quot; /&gt; ''PC Gamer'' later recognized the Clockwork Mansion as one of the best levels of 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;clockwork gamer&quot; /&gt; ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''{{'}}s Arthur Gies noted the combat system as &quot;improved and refined&quot;, the setting as &quot;''Dishonored 2''{{'}}s greatest inherited strength&quot; and the AI units for their &quot;excellent peripheral vision&quot;, yet regarded the inability to replay missions and the absence of a [[New Game Plus]] option as &quot;possible deal-breakers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poly&quot; /&gt; Alice Bell at ''[[VideoGamer.com]]'' wrote in her verdict, &quot;''Dishonored 2'' takes everything you loved about ''Dishonored'' and improves upon it without becoming bloated. It's a beautifully designed, layered game, stuffed with hidden gems and secret stories. Also you can stab people in mid air&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;VG&quot; /&gt;

===Sales===
''Dishonored 2'' was the fourth best-selling game in its first week of release, but the launch week sales dropped thirty-eight percent when compared with the original game, although only sales of physical copies were recorded.&lt;ref name=&quot;fourth best&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;first week&quot; /&gt; That same week, the game had sold the most pre-orders on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and was ranked sixth in overall sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;dry ice&quot; /&gt; It was the seventh best-selling retail video game in the UK in its second week of release, according to [[Chart-Track]], a fifty-two percent decrease from the first week – similar to that of its predecessor.&lt;ref name=&quot;chart-track&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fifty-two percent&quot; /&gt; After a reduction in cost, ''Dishonored 2'' re-entered the UK charts in the fourth week of May 2017, ranked in 8th place with a 1,267 percent rise in sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;re-entered&quot; /&gt;

&quot;'''Hated in the Nation'''&quot; is the sixth and final episode of the third season of British science fiction [[anthology series]] ''[[Black Mirror]]''. Written by series creator and showrunner [[Charlie Brooker]] and directed by [[James Hawes]], it premiered on [[Netflix]] on 21 October 2016, along with the rest of series three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Mirror Series 3 Will Premiere Sooner Than We'd Thought|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/black-mirror-season-3-will-premiere-sooner-than-wed-tho-1784411507|website=Gizmodo|language=en-US|date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the longest episode in the series at 89 minutes.

The episode is a [[Mystery film|murder mystery]], and follows Detective Karin Parke ([[Kelly Macdonald]]) and her new partner Blue Coulson ([[Faye Marsay]]) who, together with the help of [[National Crime Agency]] officer Shaun Li ([[Benedict Wong]]), try to solve the inexplicable deaths of people who were all the target of [[social media]].

The episode was critically acclaimed.

==Plot==
[[Detective Chief Inspector]] Karin Parke ([[Kelly Macdonald]]) has been summoned to a hearing. She begins speaking about Jo Powers ([[Elizabeth Berrington]]), a journalist subjected to online death threats after publicly lambasting a [[Disability rights movement|disability activist]]'s recent [[self-immolation]]. Powers returns home to the delivery of a cake reading &quot;Fucking bitch&quot;, and sees [[death threat]]s and hate messages directed at her on social media; she is later found dead, and her husband injured.

Parke investigates the death, with Trainee [[Detective Constable]] Blue Coulson ([[Faye Marsay]]) as her shadow, and Nick Shelton ([[Joe Armstrong (actor)|Joe Armstrong]]) also working on the case. The death is assumed to be murder by her husband, but he claims that Powers cut her own throat with a wine bottle, injuring him as he tried to stop her. Parke and Coulson visit the sender of the cake, Liza Bahar ([[Vinette Robinson]]), who had crowdfunded the money for it, and posted a message online reading &quot;#DeathTo Jo Powers&quot;.

The following day, a rapper named Tusk ([[Charles Babalola]]), who had also become a target of online hate for insulting a young fan, has a seizure; he is hospitalised and sedated. When Tusk is put in an [[MRI]] machine, a metal object in his brain is pulled out of his head by magnetism, killing him instantly. Both Powers' and Tusk's deaths were caused by Autonomous [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|Drone]] Insects (ADIs) – mechanical replacements for bees developed by a company called Granular to counteract a sudden [[colony collapse disorder]] in the bee population. Parke and Coulson visit Granular's headquarters, where project leader Rasmus ([[Jonas Karlsson]]) finds that an ADI was locally hacked near Powers' house on the night she was killed.

A [[National Crime Agency]] (NCA) officer, Shaun Li ([[Benedict Wong]]), is also assigned to the case. Coulson realises that Tusk and Powers were both targeted with a social media [[hashtag]], &quot;#DeathTo&quot;. The tweets originating the hashtag had a video called &quot;Game of Consequences&quot; attached which explains that each day, the person that is subject of the most &quot;#DeathTo&quot; tweets will be killed. Clara Meades ([[Holli Dempsey]]), who posted a photo where she pretended to urinate on a war memorial, is currently mentioned in the most tweets; the team take her to a safe house. Rasmus attempts to catch the hackers, but fails, and a swarm of ADIs invade the safe house through keyholes, windows and other small gaps. Though Parke and Blue attempt to hide from them with Meades, she is killed by bees entering through an air duct.

Noticing that the ADIs attacked Meades but not herself or Parke, Coulson realises that they use a [[facial recognition system]]; Li admits that the ADIs are used for government surveillance. The news begins to report on the #DeathTo hashtag, which is rapidly growing in use. The [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] Tom Pickering ([[Ben Miles]]) is the current target. Meanwhile, Parke interviews Tess Wallander ([[Georgina Rich]]), a former Granular employee who attempted suicide after receiving online hate, but was saved by her flatmate and work colleague Garrett Scholes ([[Duncan Pow]]).

Coulson and Li's analysis of the compromised ADIs reveal a digital manifesto written by Scholes, which is about forcing people to face consequences without hiding behind online anonymity. Coulson traces the location where a [[selfie]] in the document was taken; the police raid this location, yielding a disk drive. As Rasmus is preparing to use this to deactivate the ADI system, Coulson discovers the drive contains a list of hundreds of thousands of [[International Mobile Equipment Identity]] (IMEI) numbers, which can be connected to the owners' details via the government's monitoring system. They realise the list is of those who used the #DeathTo hashtag, and Parke concludes that Scholes' true plan was to use the ADIs to kill these people. However, Li ignores this and activates Rasmus' code; the system appears to be deactivated for a moment, but then the ADIs come back online and we see them target Bahar and Shelton, who had used the hashtag. All 387,036 people on the list are killed by the ADIs.

At the hearing, Parke explains that Blue Coulson has gone missing, presumed to have committed suicide; however, Parke later receives a text from her reading &quot;Got him&quot;. Scholes had fled abroad and changed his appearance, but Coulson has managed to locate him.

{{Quote box|quote=I think that social media is an amazing invention and really I suspect what needs to happen is that we just as a species get better at dealing with it and comprehending the etiquette of it and appreciating the fact that everyone on there is a real human being and that you could gravely upset someone with the things you’re saying and doing.

I’m generally against legislation against free speech but I can see it’s a massive problem when you’ve got people who are going out of their way with targeted abuse. It’s a very difficult thing to deal with. I don’t know the answer. I don’t know the answer!

People should be more accountable for what they say. It’s just difficult to see how you do that without the law getting involved. I think it’s like we’ve evolved an extra limb – social media is just like we haven’t worked out how to walk with three legs yet – we just keep banging into the walls.|align=right|width=30%|author=[[Charlie Brooker]]|source=Interview with ''The Debrief''&lt;ref name=&quot;debrief&quot;/&gt;}}

When asked whether &quot;policing [[Twitter]] is the answer&quot; to the issues in the episode, Brooker answers &quot;I don’t know the answer!&quot;, and comments that &quot;I think that social media is an amazing invention and really I suspect what needs to happen is that we just as a species get better at dealing with it&quot; and &quot;People should be more accountable for what they say. It’s just difficult to see how you do that without the law getting involved.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;debrief&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thedebrief.co.uk/things-to-do/tv-and-film/black-mirror-season-3-charlie-brooker-san-junipero/|title=Black Mirror's Charlie Brooker: 'I Feel Sorry For Millennials.

===References to earlier episodes===
In the opening flashback sequence, Karin Parke sits down in her living room to watch the news. Scrawling below the feature about the chancellor, the news ticker clearly reads: &quot;US military announces MASS project&quot;. This is in reference to the previous episode &quot;[[Men Against Fire]]&quot; where the MASS project was the featured technology for the episode. This may indicate that at the time of the flashback sequence, the events of Men Against Fire hadn't yet occurred. Later on, another news ticker displays &quot;ECHR rules 'cookies' have human rights&quot; which is a reference to the technology seen in the &quot;[[White Christmas (Black Mirror)|White Christmas]]&quot; episode.

When DCI Parke asks Blue Coulson why she left forensics, she reveals that she was the one who cracked Iain Rannoch's &quot;souvenir folder&quot; containing all the pictures and videos that had been taken by his girlfriend Victoria Skillane of the torture and murder of six-year-old Jemima Sykes. Iain Rannoch committed suicide while in custody, but the series 2 episode &quot;[[White Bear (Black Mirror)|White Bear]]&quot; covers Victoria's punishment.

In the ending scenes, when Garrett Scholes is watching the news, the headline ticker includes &quot;Shou Saito announces immersive new gaming system.&quot; This is a reference to the previous episode &quot;[[Playtest_(Black_Mirror)|Playtest]]&quot; and indicates that the tests of Shou Saito have concluded and his new game is available to the world. Also included is &quot;Skillane appeal thrown out of court&quot;, another reference to &quot;White Bear&quot;.

==Critical reception==

The episode was acclaimed by critics, who praised its writing, use of [[Twitter]], themes, acting, and final twist.

Suchandrika Chakrabarti of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' acclaimed the episode, giving it a perfect 5 rating and calling it &quot;a huge achievement&quot;, stating &quot; it's an illuminating, compelling watch, as ''Black Mirror'' does what it does best: telling us about human nature through the technology we wish for, but don't deserve&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-reviews/hatedin-thenation-black-mirror-season3-9064021|title=Hated in the Nation review: Black Mirror's finale creates a future London where everything's the same, but feels eerily different|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=26 October 2016|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Digital Spy]]'' also gave a very enthusiastic review, considering the episode &quot;a great example of how the show at its best can merge its heady high-concepts with more traditional storytelling to effectively hold that black mirror up to our own society&quot;. They highly praised the &quot;once downbeat and low-key, and yet expansively devastating&quot; climax, and called the episode &quot;a feature length story that's captivating throughout&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/black-mirror/news/a811894/black-mirror-season-3-hated-in-the-nation-review/|title=Black Mirror season 3 'Hated in the Nation' review: a blockbuster with a sting in its tail|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=23 October 2016|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Chitwood of ''[[Collider.com|Collider]]'' noted that the episode was the &quot;most thematically relevant... of this new batch, with a direct connection to the ugly side of social media and its lack of consequences.&quot;&lt;ref name=collider/&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' called the episode &quot;an inspired, frost-fringed police procedural&quot; and gave it a rating of four out of five. Zack Handlen of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a B+, stating &quot;''Black Mirror'' ends its season with a solid but unremarkable thriller&quot;. He criticized the length of the episode, despite recognizing that &quot;at least the story has enough complications that it never felt empty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/black-mirror-ends-its-season-solid-unremarkable-th-244826|title=Black Mirror ends its season with a solid but unremarkable thriller|publisher=[[The A.V.

===Critical reviews===
Caroline Preece of [[Den of Geek]] wrote &quot;The Arrow season 5 premiere is action-packed and feels like a return to the heights of season one in all the best ways...&quot; she also praised villain Tobias Church by stating &quot;The villain – Tobias Church - also ties into this nicely. He has a presence and a physicality that we haven't really seen since Slade, and that’s really evident in his showdown with Oliver in the episode. He's all knuckle-dusters and confidence, rather than vague magic or rituals. He’s also a black man, which does and doesn't matter at the same time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/arrow/44243/arrow-season-5-episode-1-review-legacy|title=Arrow season 5 episode 1 review: Legacy|work=[[Den of Geek]]|last=Preece|first=Caroline|date=6 October 2016|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alasdair Wilkins of [[The A.V. Club]] gave the episode a mixed review, he said &quot;I want to feel more optimistic than I do by the end of “Legacy,” but damn it, Arrow, we’ve been down this road before. There are about three fundamental problems Arrow needs to reckon with coming out of its fourth season, and only one of them—the tediousness of the flashbacks—looks like something the show is actively course-correcting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilkins|first=Alasdair|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/arrow-returns-least-couple-same-old-troubles-243744|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|title=Arrow returns with at least a couple of the same old troubles|date=5 October 2016|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ed Gross for [[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] gave the episode 4 stars out of 5. He commented, &quot;“Legacy” works on a number of levels. In terms of action, a hand-held and more urgent editing approach makes the fight sequences visceral, serving as an effective contrast to obviously choreographed fights of the past couple of years. Additionally, across the board the performances are strong, showing characters painfully grappling with their pasts while trying to chart new paths as they go forward. Inevitably, though, they find themselves drawn back into the world that they know best. What works particularly well is a tribute to Laurel Lance/Black Canary with the unveiling of a statue constructed in her memory. Her legacy, and what she sacrificed her life for, is extremely impactful on the characters, reminding them why they fight and what they aspire towards.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/tv/arrow-season-5-episode-1-legacy/|last=Gross|first=Ed|title=Arrow: Season 5, Episode 1 — Legacy Review|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|accessdate=2 December 2016|date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesse Schedeen of [[IGN]] gave the episode a 7.4 out of 10 with his verdict stating &quot;Arrow faces a long, uphill battle this year as it tries to move forward from the incredibly disappointing Season 4 finale. With that in mind, it's disappointing that Season 5 couldn't open on a more exciting note. There was certainly plenty to enjoy this week, from the stylish fight scenes to the dramatic performances from Stephen Amell and Paul Blackthorne. But this wasn't the fast-paced, exciting kickoff the season needed, and too much remains unclear about the show's ongoing direction right now.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schedeen|first=Jesse|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2016/10/06/arrow-legacy-review|title=Arrow: &quot;Legacy&quot; Review|date=5 October 2016|accessdate=5 December 2016|work=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|''''' Tales from Earthsea'''''|ゲド戦記|Gedo Senki|extra=literally ''Ged's War Chronicles''|lead=yes}} is a 2006 Japanese animated [[fantasy film]] directed by [[Gorō Miyazaki]], animated by [[Studio Ghibli]] for the [[Nippon Television Network]], [[Dentsu]], [[Hakuhodo DY Media Partners]], [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]], [[Mitsubishi Corporation|Mitsubishi]] and [[Toho]], and distributed by the latter company. The film is based on a combination of plot and character elements from the first four books of [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[Earthsea]]'' series (''[[A Wizard of Earthsea]]'', ''[[The Tombs of Atuan]]'', ''[[The Farthest Shore]]'', and ''[[Tehanu]]''), as well as the manga ''[[The Journey of Shuna]]'' by [[Hayao Miyazaki]]. The film's title is named from the collection of short stories, ''[[Tales from Earthsea]]'', made in 2001. The plot was &quot;entirely different&quot; according to the author Ursula K. Le Guin, who told director Gorō Miyazaki, &quot;It is not my book. It is your movie. It is a good movie&quot;, although she later expressed her disappointment with the end result.&lt;ref name=&quot;GedoSenkiResponse&quot;/&gt; A [[film comic]] adaptation of the film has been published in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;film comics&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nausicaa.net/wiki/Tales_from_Earthsea_(books)|title=Tales from Earthsea (books)|publisher=[[Nausicaa.net]]|date=August 7, 2014|author=Team Ghiblink|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The crew of a [[war galley]] are up against a storm. Suddenly two [[dragon]]s are fighting above the clouds, during which one is killed by the other (an occurrence believed impossible).

News of the kingdom declining and nothing heard from Prince Arren troubles the King of Elad. The Wizard Root speaks of dragons and men being &quot;one&quot;, divided by their particular desires (freedom and possessions respectively), which is the cause of the world's &quot;Balance&quot; weakening. Suddenly the King is fatally stabbed in a dark corridor by a boy, Arren, who steals his father's sword and flees the palace while his father dies.

In the desert, Arren is rescued from dire wolves by the Archmage Sparrowhawk. Together they travel to the city of Hort Town. When Arren explores the town alone, he rescues a young girl named Therru from slavers, but is later captured by the same slave master, Hare. His sword is discarded in the sea. Sparrowhawk rescues Arren from the slave caravan and takes him to a farm run by Sparrowhawk's friend Tenar, who lives with Therru.

Sparrowhawk's intervention against Hare's slave caravan angers Lord Cob, a powerful wizard and the ruler of Hort Town, who wants the archmage brought to the castle. Meanwhile, Sparrowhawk tells Arren that he seeks a way to restore the upset Balance, then resumes his search in Hort Town. While there he buys Arren's sword from a merchant's stall and manages to evade capture from Hare whilst learning about Cob's castle.

Arren confesses to Therru that he killed his father and that feels an unknown presence following him. Because of this, Arren leaves the farm, but is met by the presence, which is a mirror image of himself. Arren falls unconscious after stumbling into a swamp while fleeing from the image. Cob takes him to the castle, where he manipulates him into revealing his &quot;[[Characters in Earthsea#Nom|true name]]&quot;, Lebannen, to control him. Meanwhile, Hare captures Tenar as bait to lure Sparrowhawk into the castle leaving Therru tied to a post as a messenger. She frees herself, and encounters Sparrowhawk, who gives her Arren's sword to give to Arren. Sparrowhawk breaks into the castle to save Tenar and confronts Cob. Sparrowhawk learns that Cob is causing the world's Balance to collapse by opening the door between life and death to try and gain eternal life. Sparrowhawk tries to warn Cob of the dangers of upsetting the Balance, and Cob sends Arren out to kill him. Sparrowhawk frees Arren from Cob's control but is captured by Hare, his power having been weakened within the stronghold of Cob's castle.

Meanwhile, Therru sees the same copy of Arren and follows him to the castle, where he reveals that he is the light within Arren and tells Therru his true name. Therru enters the castle and learns of Sparrowhawk and Tenar's sunrise execution. She finds Arren, guilty and hopeless, and brings hope back to him, calling him by his true name and confiding in him her own true name, Tehanu. They rush to rescue Sparrowhawk and Tenar. Arren confronts Cob, who tries to kill him, he fights back and finally unsheathes his sword, which was sealed with magic. Arren cuts off Cob's staff-holding hand. Unable to use his magic powers, Cob rapidly begins to age. He captures Therru and flees to the highest tower of the castle, with Arren in pursuit. Cornering Cob, Arren tries to explain what he learned about life and death from Therru and Sparrowhawk to Cob, but Cob refuses to listen and uses the last of his magic to strangle Therru to death. However, she does not die as she has eternal life, and instead becomes a dragon. Therru kills Cob by burning him alive and rescues Arren from the collapsing castle tower.

Sparrowhawk and Tenar leave the castle, and meanwhile Therru and Arren land in a field where Therru changes back into a human. Arren tells Therru he will leave for home to repent for his crime, but will come back to see her some day. After Arren and Therru reunite with Sparrowhawk and Tenar, the four of them spend time together. Arren and Sparrowhawk depart for Enlad, bidding Therru and Tenar goodbye. Therru looks up to see dragons peacefully flying in the sky, indicating that the world's Balance is returning to normal.

==Production==
This feature film from Studio Ghibli is the first anime film adaptation of any part of the Earthsea series. In the past, many directors, including Hayao Miyazaki,&lt;ref name=&quot;shuffle&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In 2003, after winning an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for his film ''[[Spirited Away]]'', Hayao Miyazaki received Le Guin's approval but was busy directing [[Howl's Moving Castle (film)|''Howl's Moving Castle'']]. Studio Ghibli head Toshio Suzuki decided that Hayao's son Gorō Miyazaki, who was advising on the film, should be given his first directing job for the adaptation. Hayao was dissatisfied with the decision, thinking that Gorō lacked the necessary experience. They reportedly did not speak to one another during production of the film. However, Hayao later acknowledged his son's work upon its first preview.&lt;ref&gt;See Nausicaa.net [http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/earthsea/blog/blog112.html Goro Miyazaki's Blog].&lt;/ref&gt; Some feel that a major section of the plot was adapted from the director's father, Hayao Miyazaki's ''[[The Journey of Shuna]]'' graphic novel, with many direct references. Le Guin, who had become a devoted fan of Hayao Miyazaki's work following their first encounter and had wished for him to direct the film, was also disappointed by the selection of Goro as director, but was told by Studio Ghibli that Hayao would oversee the film's production.&lt;ref name=&quot;GedoSenkiResponse&quot;/&gt;

===Music===
The soundtrack for ''Tales from Earthsea'' was composed and managed by Tamiya Terashima and was released by [[Tokuma Japan Communications]] and Studio Ghibli Records as a [[Surround sound|multichannel]] hybrid [[Super Audio CD|SACD]]-CD on 12 July 2006. [[Carlos Núñez Muñoz|Carlos Núñez]] was a key collaborator on the soundtrack, contributing his [[ocarina]], [[whistle]] and [[Galician gaita]] (bagpipe) to 11 of the 21 tracks. Newcomer singer, [[Aoi Teshima]], sang in 2 of the tracks. A follow-up album, &quot;Melodies from Gedo Senki&quot;, was released on 17 January 2007 and included unreleased Gedo Senki OST tracks and new tracks by Núñez.&lt;ref&gt;Ghibliworld, [http://pages.citebite.com/x1f1q8t3f0kkj MEMORIES FROM GEDO SENKI WITH CARLOS NUNEZ], 19 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} Studio Ghibli, [http://www.ghibli.jp/10info/003503.html カルロス・ヌニェスのニューアルバムの発売決定！], 11 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trailer==
Studio Ghibli released the first and second trailers on its official web site. A three-minute Japanese trailer was first shown in Japanese cinemas starting Saturday 24 February 2006. It was aired on [[Nippon Television|NTV]] on 23 February 2006 (the day the trailer was completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;blog23&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailers were made by Keiichi Itagaki, who had been responsible for trailers for all of the other Ghibli films up until then.

==Reception==
The film reached No. 1 at the Japanese Box Office on its opening week with a gross of over 900 million [[JPY|yen]], or 7.7 million [[USD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425111559/http://www.madman.com.au/actions/news.do?method=view&amp;newsId=712|archivedate=April 25, 2009|url=http://www.madman.com.au/actions/news.do?method=view&amp;newsId=712|title=Tales from Earthsea tops Japanese box office|publisher=[[Madman Entertainment]]|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; pushing ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' to second place and became the number one movie in the country for five weeks,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eiga.com/ranking/060815.shtml#jp Ranking at Eiga.com from 2006-08-15] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922100130/http://www.eiga.com/ranking/060815.shtml |date=2006-09-22 }} {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; until it was pushed out of the top spot when ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' was released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinemanavi.co.jp/english/end3.html Box Office Japan's Weekly Statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120530181817/http://www.cinemanavi.co.jp/english/end3.html |date=2012-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie went on to be the #4 top-grossing movie for the year in Japan.

[[Ursula K. Le Guin]], the author of the ''Earthsea'' series, gave a mixed response to the film in her review on her website. Le Guin commended the visual animation in the film but stated that the plot departed so greatly from her story that she was &quot;watching an entirely different story, confusingly enacted by people with the same names as in my story&quot;. She also praised certain depictions of nature in the film, but felt that the production values of the film were not as high as previous works directed by Hayao Miyazaki, and that the film's excitement was focused too much around scenes of violence. Her initial response to Gorō Miyazaki was &quot;[I]t is not my book. It is your movie. It is a good movie&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GedoSenkiResponse&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ursulakleguin.com/GedoSenkiResponse.html |title=Gedo Senki, a First Response |accessdate=2006-08-15 |author=Ursula K. Le Guin |authorlink=Ursula K. Le Guin |date= |work=UrsulaKLeguin.com |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she stated that the comment disclosed on the movie's public blog did not portray her true feelings about the film's vast departure from original stories; &quot;taking bits and pieces out of context, and replacing the storylines with an entirely different plot...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GedoSenkiResponse&quot;/&gt;

Le Guin's mixed opinion of the film is indicative of the overall reception of the film, particularly in Japan. In Japan, the film found both strong proponents and detractors. Many of the opinions can best be summed up in a response to Le Guin's comments on her website, that the weak points of the film were the result of &quot;when too much responsibility was shouldered by someone not equipped for it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GedoSenkiCorrespondents&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ursulakleguin.com/GedoSenkiCorrespondents.html |title=Gedo Senki: Responses from Correspondents |accessdate= |author=Ursula K. Le Guin |authorlink=Ursula K. Le Guin |date=2006-08-19 |work=UrsulaKLeguin.com |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The critical reception in Japan was positive, but received mixed reviews when comparing it to the other Ghibli movies. Miyazaki was presented Japan's Bunshun Raspberry Award for &quot;Worst Director&quot;, with ''Tales from Earthsea'' receiving the award for &quot;Worst Movie&quot;, at the end of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-01-25/earthsea-wins-rasperry-award Earthsea Wins &quot;Raspberry Award&quot; - Anime News Network]&lt;/ref&gt; The film was nominated in 2007 for the [[Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year]] (losing to ''[[The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (2006 film)|The Girl Who Leapt Through Time]]'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080306042519/http://www.japan-academy-prize.jp/allprizes/2007/index.html Official website of the award.

[[Rotten Tomatoes]]' Tomatometer shows a rating of 41%, making it the only &quot;Rotten&quot; film produced by Studio Ghibli.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gedo-senki-tales-from-earthsea/ Gedo senki (Tales from Earthsea)]. Rotten Tomatoes. Retrieved on 2014-05-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International releases==
''Tales from Earthsea'' was released in a limited theatrical release on 13 August 2010, in North America by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. In its American release, the film was rated PG-13 by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] for some violent images, making it the first and only animated film distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Disney]] to receive a PG-13 rating. It is also the second Studio Ghibli film to receive this rating after ''[[Princess Mononoke]]''. The DVD release date was 8 March 2011. [[GKIDS]] re-issued the movie on Blu-ray &amp; DVD on February 6, 2018 under a new deal with Studio Ghibli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/gkids-studio-ghibli-ink-home-entertainment-deal-1021746|title=Gkids, Studio Ghibli Ink Home Entertainment Deal|author=Carolyn Giardina|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=July 17, 2017|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was released in selected UK cinemas on 3 August 2007, in both subtitled and English dubbed versions. The film was not released as widely as previous Ghibli movies, playing to 23 venues across the nation and making an unremarkable £23,300.&lt;ref name=&quot;uk-box-office&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/uk/?yr=2007&amp;wk=31&amp;p=.htm|title=United Kingdom Box Office, August 3–5, 2007|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date=August 3, 2007|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews were generally positive, but received mixed reviews when it was compared to the past Ghibli films.

The film began a single print tour of major cities on 25 April 2007 and ended up playing at locations in [[Brisbane]], Sydney, Melbourne, [[Adelaide]] and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] over the following months. It was notable that unlike previous Studio Ghibli releases, only a subtitled version was seen in cinemas.

A 2-disc DVD was released on 12 September 2007 by [[Madman Entertainment]], this time featuring both the English and Japanese versions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://b2b.madman.com.au/actions/catalogue.do?method=view&amp;releaseId=8090 Madman Release Schedule]&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, ''Tales from Earthsea'' (Cuentos de Terramar) premiered only in [[Madrid]] and [[Barcelona]] in two small theaters on 28 December 2007, only in a Japanese version with subtitles (an odd theatrical release compared to previous Ghibli movies). A single DVD and a special 2-disc DVD were released on 12 March 2008 by [[Aurum Producciones|Aurum]], this time with a Spanish soundtrack included.

'''''Police Quest: Open Season''''' is the fourth installment of [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]]'s popular [[Police Quest|''Police Quest'' series]]. Released in November 1993, it was created by retired Police Chief [[Daryl F. Gates]], who was the Chief of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) from 1978 to 1992. He replaced ex-California Highway Patrol officer [[Jim Walls]] as the designer of the franchise.

The game is listed as ''Police Quest 4'' (''PQ4'') in the manual. It is also shown in the file names and the credits, and when exiting the game in DOS, &quot;Thank you for playing ''Police Quest IV: Open Season''&quot;. The number does not appear on the title screen.

==Gameplay==
Police Quest IV differs significantly from the first three games, in both game engine and story.  The player plays the character of [[homicide detective]] John Carey (portrayed by Sierra actor ''Brandon Massey''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Police Quest: Open Season (1993) |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289401/ |website=IMDb |accessdate=29 June 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209005831/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289401/ |archivedate=9 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than officer Sonny Bonds, and the game is set in [[Los Angeles, California]] rather than the [[fiction]]al Lytton.  Backgrounds for the game are digital [[photograph]]s rather than painted scenery, and depict real locations in Los Angeles.  The [[Parker Center]] is a location used in the game, and is virtually unchanged from when the game was made. Written text is replaced by audible narration and dialogues on the CD version, released in 1996.

The entire game, like ''[[Police Quest III: The Kindred|Police Quest III]]'' and the 1991 re-make of ''[[Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel|Police Quest 1]]'', is based on a mouse-controlled user-interface system. Icons for &quot;walking&quot;, &quot;speaking, &quot;using&quot; and &quot;looking&quot; are used rather than the old-fashioned text-[[parsing]] system used in the first two games.

Homages to Sonny Bonds appear in two places: the name of the police server is &quot;SONNY&quot; and &quot;Sonny Bonds&quot; also appears on the high score screens of the two arcade games in the Short Stop Bar (CD version only).

==Plot==
The game starts in a [[South Central Los Angeles]] alley at around 3:00 AM. Carey finds his best friend and ex-partner, Officer Bob Hickman, murdered on the scene, alongside eight-year-old Bobby Washington. The seemingly random string of gang-related murders continues along, providing Carey with clues to find his killer(s).

After 5 people are murdered, mutilated and found in public places, Carey finally closes in on the [[serial killer|killer]]. He stumbled across the proprietor of a second-rate [[movie theatre]], who has a stuttering problem. The owner offers him some tea and invites him into the theatre to watch a film. Carey passes out and hallucinates that the proprietor is the cross-dresser seen near the body of Hickman. The owner wakes Carey up and throws him out of the theatre. Carey finds the killer's house (led there by his dog), only to find a [[decapitation|severed head]] in a [[refrigerator|fridge]]. Carey finds a hidden passage that leads back to the theatre, and finds a woman passed out in the seats. When he returns, he sees the owner dragging the unconscious woman into a back room. Carey is subsequently knocked unconscious. However, Carey manages to scrounge up some hairspray and a lighter, finds the woman covered in blood with the killer looming over her, and torches the killer. Although the woman is limp and covered in blood, we can assume that Carey saved her because the mayor mentions that only 5 people were killed, as he presents Carey with the [[Los Angeles Police Medal of Valor|Medal of Valor]].

==Realism==
The game's gritty realism greatly emphasizes a homicide detective's line of work, requiring the player to follow standard police procedures and thoroughly investigate crime scenes to every extent. As such realism is presented in the form of working to find and link clues, the game also depicts a gruesome photo-realistic nature.{{r|owens199403}} The CD version of the game contained copies of official LA police department employee and community relation policies.

At the beginning of the game, an eight-year-old boy is found murdered from gunshot wounds in a dumpster, close-ups of Hickman's body are revealed, and towards the end of the game, the player will find a severed head in a refrigerator before ultimately stumbling upon the killer, who is fondling a victim's corpse. It is believed the killer in the game is based on serial killer [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], noted for keeping body parts from his victims inside his house. The game, like several other Sierra games of the era, is also notable for the fact that the main character can be killed by many hazards; the game ends if a player constantly [[sexual harassment|harasses]] female employees at the Parker Center, or if he shoots non-threatening people.

''Open Season'' also featured mature sexual themes.  At one point, the player visits a stripper's nightclub in [[West Hollywood]], and learns about his friend's secret life.  The realism is complemented by a unique reaction for inappropriate use of items in the player's inventory, rather than a generic &quot;I can't do that&quot; statement.

''Open Season'' also included profanity used by characters &quot;Hal Bottoms&quot;, &quot;Nicolette Rogers&quot;, &quot;Dennis Walker&quot; as the player talks to them in the game.

==Development and release==
The same year ''Open Season'' was released, ex-Police Quest developer [[Jim Walls]] released a very similar game called ''[[Blue Force]]''. Although ''Blue Force'' is graphically more similar to ''Police Quest III'', the storyline and completion time are shorter.

Also, for the 1996 release of the game, a two-minute promotional video was included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syzQSK16jcY |title=Making Of Police Quest IV: Opean Season |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=2007-06-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016193401/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syzQSK16jcY |archivedate=2013-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
''Open Season'' was met with some controversy for its perceived portrayal of some African-American characters and the stereotypical use of [[African American Vernacular English|jive talk]], of which the game was accused of portraying in   an [[Amos 'n' Andy]]-style dialect. Examples of this include a witness introducing himself as &quot;I be Raymond Jones the third&quot;, &quot;I jest be out for some fresh LA air&quot; or &quot;Yo, I be fly today!&quot;. Although credited as the game's author, [[Daryl F. Gates]] did not write the game's story line, he renounced the inclusion of aforementioned dialogue in the game insisting they were not his idea. He said &quot;I told [Sierra] that these people use the same language as you and I use. A lot of that was changed. It is not intended to offend anyone&quot;. Instead, Gates claimed that the story had been penned by Sierra's Tammy Dargan, a former segment producer for ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''. Dargan in turn, claimed that the lingo was inspired by [[Fab Five Freddy]]'s &quot;Fresh Fly Flavor&quot;.&lt;ref name=Vibe&gt;

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated in February 1994 that &quot;''Police Quest: Open Season'' evinces a remarkable degree of work-a-day police realism as a result of Gates' contributions&quot;, with &quot;marvelous digitized backgrounds&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cgw199402&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=February 1994 |title=Taking A Peek |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&amp;pub=2&amp;id=115 |magazine=Computer Gaming World |pages=212-220}}&lt;/ref&gt; A longer review in March 1994 stated that the game had succeeded &quot;at so many levels&quot;, that its realism and &quot;seemingly endless amounts of&quot; police procedure offered &quot;larger implications about our society and its struggle against the drug machine&quot;. The reviewer noted that treating NPCs with the same &quot;lack of consideration&quot; players do so in other games &quot;seems incredibly damning—and heartrending—because it's true to life. We treat each other, the game implies, in our attempts merely to cope with the problems with which we are faced, like NPCs&quot;. The magazine concluded that &quot;''Open Season'' tells that story magnificently&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;owens199403&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Owens |first=Dennis |date=March 1994 |title=The Killing Game |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&amp;pub=2&amp;id=116 |magazine=Computer Gaming World |pages=44-45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Death in Rome''''' ({{lang-de|Der Tod in Rom: Roman}}) is a [[1954 in literature|1954]] [[German literature|German]] [[novel]] by [[Wolfgang Koeppen]], who belonged to the literary generation of [[West Germany]] which had to revive the devastated cultural landscape after twelve years of the &quot;brown plague&quot; and the ruin of the war, and, was one of the first artists to embroider the new social and political realities of the country when the wave of chauvinistic and revanchist psychosis broke out. An exploration of themes associated with the Holocaust, German guilt, conflict between generations, and, the silencing of the past, it is, after ''{{ill|Pigeons on the Grass|de|Tauben im Gras}}'' ({{lang-de|Tauben im Gras: Roman}}, [[1951 in literature|1951]], which recreates a typical day in [[Munich]] in 1948) and ''{{ill|The Hothouse (novel)|lt=The Hothouse|bg|Оранжерията|de|Das Treibhaus}}'' ({{lang-de|Das Treibhaus: Roman}}, [[1953 in literature|1953]], which deals with the corruption of the Bonn government), the third work of the so-called ''Trilogy of Failure'' ({{lang-de|Trilogie des Scheiterns}}), about postwar life in West Germany, with which Koeppen established himself as an important figure in German post-war literature. It opens with a quotation from [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'': ''Il mal seme d'Adamo'', followed by the last sentence from ''Death in Venice'': ''Und noch desselben Tages empfing eine respektvoll erschütterte Welt die Nachricht von seinem Tode''.

==Synopsis==
The novel, which contains the worst accusations against German militarism, and, reveals the dangerous influence of [[fascism|fascist]] ideology on certain social strata in West Germany, warns and prophesies. It deals with the careers of former [[Nazism|National Socialists]] after [[World War II]]. Against the backdrop of [[Rome]], which assumes the function of a metaphor and at the same time is a specific decor of the events described, as, its ancient monuments predispose to reflection on the fate of the world, the nature of good and evil, war and peace, past and future, wealth and poverty, and, justice and social oppression, victims and perpetrators from the time of National Socialism meet during the post-war period. In a kind of literary choreography, the author composes new groups of figures from the members of two families and their surrounding environment in several parallel lines of action. In an artistic network of dialogues and inner monologues, the present is problematized and the past uncovered. The characters show the opportunism and the adaptability of the followers, as well as the unbroken violence of the perpetrators, like the torn-upness and escapism of the next generation. The background is the still unsolved problem of overcoming the National Socialist past in the time of the ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]''. The novel has a peculiar connection with [[Thomas Mann]]'s ''[[Death in Venice]]'' ({{lang-de|Der Tod in Venedig: Novelle}}, [[1912 in literature|1912]]), most notably by addressing the problems of artistic creativity against the background of moral decay. Stylistically, ''Death in Rome'' is similar to the other two novels of Wolfgang Koeppen. Here, too, the writer manifests himself as the master of the metaphorically rich, richly associative prose. Koeppen uses, with great skill, the stylistic means of cinema – the installation, the constant change of view and the distance to the depicted event, and, the simultaneous performance of the action. The epic narrative is coupled with the internal monologue of the characters, which, according to the writer, &quot;best suits our perception, our consciousness, and, our bitter experience.&quot; The author presents himself with his novel ''Death in Rome'' as a politically- and socially-engaged writer. In his speech, given in 1962, when he received the [[Georg Büchner Prize]], he stated: &quot;I saw the poet, the writer of those who were rejected by the public, I saw him as suffering and sympathetic to the alien grief. Later, I heard about engaging literature, and, it struck me that something of a self-worth, something like breathing, wants to make an artistic stance or a fashion.&quot; He never advocated a certain ideology or political program. His works are the words he puts in the mouth of one of the heroes of the novel ''Death in Rome'': &quot;I ask questions, yet, I do not know the answer, I cannot answer.&quot; Koeppen called his works &quot;a monologue attempt against the world.&quot; However, by virtue of a particular paradox, his protest against existence is also a plea for new, more humane form of life. It for this reason that he was called, by [[Alfred Andersch]], a &quot;humanistic pessimist.&quot; And this hidden humanistic pathos outside the resignation inspires a lasting literary life, and, the novel ''Death in Rome''. Koeppen said of his novel: &quot;We all live with politics, we are all its subjects or even victims of it. How can the writer behave like the ostrich, and, who, if not the writer, must take on the role of [[Cassandra]] in our society?&quot;

==Characters==
One of the main characters is a Nazi criminal, General '''Gottlieb Judejahn''' of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' and the ''[[Freikorps]]''. He was sentenced ''in absentia'' to death at the [[Nuremberg trials]], yet, has escaped retribution. He is a professional executioner, he embodies all the misdeeds, the whole barbarity of fascism. Judejahn is still convinced that he did the right thing by killing and destroying people. With sadistic delight, he recalls the images of his victims in memory – in these memories he finds refuge when he is unhappy with his present life. Judejahn believes he is a hero, bearer of all German virtues, the embodiment of the duty fulfilled to the &quot;deity of power&quot; [[Adolf Hitler]]. He escaped to an Arab country whose military he is trying to build up in order to defeat [[Israel]]. He is in Rome to buy weapons and to meet members of his family, including his wife, '''Eva'''. His wife, Eva, is portrayed as some &quot;[[Nordic race|Nordic]] [[Erinyes|Erinye]],&quot; dreaming of the revival of the Third Reich, the triumph of the &quot;millennial empire,&quot; and, the German domination over the world. Even her husband, whom she blindly worshiped, prefers to socialize with the &quot;fallen heroes,&quot; with the &quot;martyrs&quot; of Nazism, not with the survivors, however, they have lost their power and majesty. The meeting between the two husbands, between the two Nazi monsters, was conveyed by the writer with extraordinary power and artistic impetus. 

Their son, '''Adolf''', has replaced the SS with the cassock. With the collapse of the fascist myth, he lost all sorts of omnipresent stands and sought support and salvation in the [[Catholic Church]]. Fearing to make any personal decisions, he tries to rise above all parties and fronts in the name of &quot;all-human tolerance.&quot; Still, the young man cannot free himself from the thought that the Church has been linked to fascist doctrine, and, has, in fact, been supporting this &quot;assassin gang.&quot; Both Gottlieb and Adolf pursue a Jewish barmaid named '''Laura''' who works in a gay bar, and, Gottlieb eventually rapes her. 

Another significant character in the novel is the kinsman of the [[Essen]] general, '''Friedrich Wilhelm Pfaffrath'''. He is, at first glance, a distinctly orderly person. Although he was once a president and manager of large Nazi properties, although he was part of the German bourgeoisie who unconditionally assumed Hitler's authority, he is now a high-ranking public official – he was elected the first mayor and head of his town. There are many people like him, they have penetrated to all the corners of the [[Bonn]] state apparatus, occupying leadership positions, they redefine the destiny of the country. Pfaffrath is real, devoid of demonism, yet, no less ominous than Judejahn. He is filled with the desire to help the former hangmen return to the Federal Republic with impunity, to integrate into the Bonn political system. Pfaffrath believes that the West German society is mature enough to accept the &quot;prodigal son&quot; who has escaped the gallows. Thus, Pfaffrath embodies the vitality of nationalism in the country. Eva's sister, '''Anna''', is married to Friedrich Pfaffrath.

The inescapableness of his stratum is confirmed by the image of the youngest member of his family – the law student '''Dietrich Pfaffrath'''. He is a promising careerist who does not worry about moral problems or thoughts about his father's fascist past. Even Judejahn does not interfere with his life – the calculating Dietrich well appreciated that it is not far off the time when his kinship with the former general may be honorable and profitable. Koeppen has conceived the image of Dietrich as a symbol of the resurgent loyalty, which finds its roots in order, the state, and, the mighty power.

Opposed to all these bright negative images, the writer opposes a hero, who can be called the chief one, mostly because he carries some autobiographical traits. The composer '''Siegfried Pfaffrath''', a homosexual and pederast who frequents boy prostitutes, lives after the end of the war in Rome to distance himself from his German relatives and leave behind his father's house. He seeks to express his worldview and musicality by using [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[twelve-tone technique]], blasted in the Third Reich. Siegfried loves Rome because he feels alien here. However, he is infinitely lonely and constantly lives on the brink of despair. This is his gut feeling that fills his music. He composed works, deliberately deprived of harmony, expressing his image of the world over which he has overcome the danger of an irreparable crash. For Siegfried, music is an expression of the horror of man in the era of gas chambers and mass murders. His works are a &quot;rebellion against the surrounding reality,&quot; against his fatherland, against the war, for whom people like his parents are responsible.

'''Ilse Kürenberg''', wife of the world-renowned conductor, '''Kürenberg''', who presents the first symphony of Siegfried in front of the audience, perceives the dissonant work as a &quot;no-goal search,&quot;, conquered by despair. However, she cannot explain whether Siegfried is desperate because he cannot find a way to a meaningful life, or, even if his despair hinders him all the way. And, the conductor, who feels the artist's dissatisfaction with his work, protects him from the danger of closing himself in an &quot;ivory tower&quot; because of the world's disappointment. Siegfried's music is a mockery of the eloquent taste of the self-styled patrons and connoisseurs of art who occupy the ground floor of the concert hall. He dreams of understanding and accepting the young people, the workers, and, the students to whom the future belongs. However, at the concert, the gallery does not accept the composer – it does not perceive in his symphony a resonance of life. This music reflects the tragedy of a talented artist who is unable to break the limits of the denial and develop constructive ideas. Siegfried, although receiving a prize at a modern music competition, is unhappy with the result – he does not applaud his symphony, only the rich snobs from the ground floor do so. And the young composer places great hopes on the music – maybe it is judged &quot;with time to contribute to great changes.&quot; Ilse, who is [[Jews|Jewish]], survived [[the Holocaust]] as she and her [[Gentile]] husband could afford to live outside [[Germany]] during the war. Siegfried and Adolf are representatives of the generation of sons who do not want to inherit their fathers, and every succession – both the composer and the cleric – seeks new goals and a new meaning for their lives. Both know the exalted suffering of loneliness. From this loneliness Siegfried finds a way out of Rome and leaves for [[Africa]]. He hopes to return from there to [[New York City]], with a &quot;black symphony&quot; – a symbol of commitment to the inborn problems of mankind. Gottlieb shoots and kills Ilse, whose father had been victimized by the Nazis, at the novel's end, before suffering a heart attack

&quot;'''Porphyria's Lover'''&quot; is a poem by [[Robert Browning]] which was first published as &quot;Porphyria&quot; in the January 1836 issue of ''[[Monthly Repository]]''. Browning later republished it in ''[[Dramatic Lyrics]]'' (1842) paired with &quot;[[Johannes Agricola in Meditation]]&quot; under the title &quot;Madhouse Cells&quot;. The poem did not receive its definitive title until 1863.

&quot;Porphyria's Lover&quot; is Browning's first ever short [[dramatic monologue]], and also the first of his poems to examine abnormal psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, Robert. ''Browning: [[Pippa Passes]] and Shorter Poems'' (Joseph E. Baker, Editor). New York: The Odyssey Press, 1947, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Although its initial publication passed nearly unnoticed and it received little critical attention in the nineteenth century, the poem is now heavily anthologised and much studied.

In the poem, a man strangles his lover&amp;nbsp;– Porphyria&amp;nbsp;– with her hair; &quot;... and all her hair&amp;nbsp;/ In one long yellow string I wound&amp;nbsp;/ Three times her little throat around,&amp;nbsp;/ And strangled her.&quot; Porphyria's lover then talks of the corpse's blue eyes, golden hair, and describes the feeling of perfect happiness the murder gives him. Although he winds her hair around her throat 3 times to throttle her, the woman never cries out. The poem uses a somewhat unusual rhyme scheme: A,B,A,B,B, the final repetition bringing each stanza to a heavy rest. 

A possible source for the poem is John Wilson's &quot;Extracts from Gosschen's Diary&quot;, a lurid account of a murder published in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' in 1818. Browning's friend and fellow poet [[Bryan Procter]] acknowledged basing his 1820 &quot;Marcian Colonna&quot; on this source, but added a new detail; after the murder, the killer sits up all night with his victim.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Catherine. &quot;Porphyria's Lover&quot;, ''The Explicator'', Winter 2002, p. 68(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological interpretations==

Browning's monologues are frequently voiced by [[eccentricity (behavior)|eccentrics]], lunatics, or people under emotional stress. Their ramblings illustrate character by describing the interactions of an odd personality with a particularly telling set of circumstances. In both &quot;Porphyria's Lover&quot; and &quot;[[My Last Duchess]]&quot;, Browning uses this mode of exposition to describe a man who responds to the love of a beautiful woman by killing her. Each monologue offers the speaker's reasons for the desired woman from subject to object: in &quot;My Last Duchess&quot;, the Duke may have jealously murdered his wife, but keeps a portrait of her behind a curtain so none can look upon her smile without his permission; in &quot;Porphyria's Lover&quot;, the persona wishes to stop time at a single perfect moment and so kills his lover and sits all night embracing her carefully arranged body. It should be noted that in &quot;My Last Duchess&quot; the woman's murder is at best implied, while in &quot;Porphyria's Lover&quot; it is described quite explicitly by the speaker. The unchanging rhythmic pattern may also suggest the persona's insanity. 
    
The &quot;Porphyria&quot; persona's romantic egotism leads him into all manner of monstrously selfish assumptions compatible with his own longings. He seems convinced that Porphyria wanted to be murdered, and claims &quot;No pain felt she&quot; while being strangled, adding, as if to convince himself, &quot;I am quite sure she felt no pain.&quot;  He may even believe she enjoyed the pain, because he, her lover, inflicted it. When she's dead, he says she's found her &quot;utmost will,&quot; and when he sees her lifeless head drooping on his shoulder, he describes it as a &quot;smiling rosy little head&quot;, possibly using the word &quot;rosy&quot; to symbolise the red roses of love, or to demonstrate his delusion that the girl, and their relationship, are still alive.  More likely, however, is the thought that blood returning to her face, after the strangulation, makes her cheeks &quot;rosy.&quot;  Her &quot;rosy little head&quot; may also be a sly reference to the hymen; Porphyria leaves a &quot;gay feast&quot; and comes in from the outside world wearing &quot;soiled gloves&quot;; now her blue eyes, open in death, are &quot;without a stain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The lover may also be a [[Sexual fetishism|fetishist]], indicated by the fact that he refers to her hair numerous times throughout the poem, and strangles her with it. He also refers to the &quot;shut bud that holds a bee&quot; which backs up the view of it being a sexual fetish.

Since the speaker may (as many speculate{{Who|date=February 2010}}) be insane, it is impossible to know the true nature of his relationship to Porphyria. Theories, some of them rather bizarre, abound: some contemporary scholars suggest, for example, that the persona may be a woman; if so, the strangulation could stem from frustration with the world.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  An incestuous relationship has also been suggested; Porphyria might be the speaker's mother or sister. Another possibility is that she is a former lover, now betrothed, or even married, to some other man. Alternatively, she may simply be some kind lady who has come to look in on him, or even a figment of his imagination.

Other sources speculate that the lover might be impotent, disabled, sick, or otherwise inadequate, and, as such, unable to satisfy Porphyria. There is much textual evidence to support this interpretation: he describes himself as &quot;one so pale&amp;nbsp;/ for love of her, and all in vain.&quot; At the beginning of the poem, the persona never moves; he sits passively in a cold, dark room, sadly listening to the storm until Porphyria comes through &quot;wind and rain&quot;, &quot;shuts the cold out and the storm,&quot; and makes up his dying fire.  Finally, she sits beside him, calls his name, places his arm around her waist, and puts his head on her shoulder; interestingly, she has to stoop to do this.  At the poem's midpoint, the persona suddenly takes action, strangling Porphyria, propping her body against his, and boasting that afterward, ''her'' head lay on ''his'' shoulder.

In line with the persona's suggested weakness and sickness, other scholars take the word &quot;[[porphyria]]&quot; literally, and suggest that the seductress embodies a disease, and that the persona's killing of her is a sign of his recovery. Porphyria, which usually involved delusional madness and death, was classified several years before the poem's publication; Browning, who had an avid interest in such pathologies, may well have been aware of the new disease, and used it in this way to express his knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Popowich, Barry L. &quot;Porphyria is Madness&quot;. ''Studies in Browning and his Circle'', May 1999, pp. 59–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much has been made of the final line: &quot;And yet, God has not said a word!&quot; Possibly, the speaker seeks divine condonement for the murder. He may believe God has said nothing because He is satisfied with his actions.  God may be satisfied because: He recognises that the persona's crime is the only way to keep Porphyria pure; or, because He doesn't think her life and death are important compared to the persona's. The persona may also be waiting in vain for some sign of God's approval. Alternatively, the line may represent his feelings of emptiness in the wake of his violence; Porphyria is gone, quiet descends, and he's alone. The persona may also be [[schizophrenic]]; he may be listening for a voice in his head, which he mistakes for the voice of God. It has also been postulated that this is Browning's statement of &quot;God's silence,&quot; in which neither good nor bad acts are immediately recompensed by the deity.

The final line may also register the persona's sense of guilt over his crime. Despite his elaborate justifications for his act, he has, in fact, committed murder, and he expects God to punish him&amp;nbsp;– or, at least, to take notice. The persona is surprised, perhaps a little uneasy, at God's continued silence.

==As tableau vivant==
The mirrored effect produced by Porphyria's modelling of the persona in the first half, and the persona's reciprocal modelling of her after strangulation is indicative of a popular Victorian art form in which humans were used as art to recreate actual paintings. This is indicative of the allegorical content of &quot;Porphyria's Lover&quot; in which both characters imitate the process of artistic creation: when art is created or published, it is dead and forever unchanging.  In the last few lines of the poem, Porphyria is manipulated in much the same way as the speaker was in the first few lines of the poem. [[Alfred Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] shares similar ideas in &quot;[[The Lady of Shalott]]&quot;, as do other [[Victorian era|Victorian]] authors who contribute to the popular conversation about the artistic processes.

'''''Dishonored: Death of the Outsider''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[Stealth game|stealth]] [[video game]] developed by [[Arkane Studios]] and published by [[Bethesda Softworks]]. It is the third game in the ''Dishonored'' series, following ''[[Dishonored 2]]'', and was released 15 September 2017 on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]]. It follows former-assassin Billie Lurk as she finds her mentor Daud and aids in his quest to kill [[The Outsider (Dishonored)|the Outsider]], a supernatural being who bestows magical powers on a select few.

==Gameplay==
The player can use various gadgets and gear. One such gadget is the hook mine. The hook mine can be placed on any surface, including walls and ceilings, and will grab any enemies and pull them towards it. This can be used to non-lethally neutralise a target or hide a body, though two hook mines placed nearby to each other can rip NPCs in half (killing them).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/dishonored-2-death-of-the-outsiders-hook-mines-look-very-cool/ |title=Dishonored 2 Death of the Outsider's Hook Mines look very, very cool |last=Donnelly |first=Joe |date=6 September 2017 |work=PC Gamer |access-date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first mission, the player gains access to three supernatural abilities, which cost energy to use; this energy regenerates to full over a short amount of time. Unlike previous games in the series, these abilities are all unlocked at the same time.&lt;ref name=&quot;End&quot;/&gt; Lurk's main mobility power is &quot;Displace&quot;, which allows her to set a marker in the world. The player can then teleport to it at-will at any time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Displace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/billies-displace-ability-sounds-awesome-in-dishonored-2-death-of-the-outsider/ |title=Billie's 'displace' ability sounds awesome in Dishonored 2: Death of the Outsider |last=Donnelly |first=Joe |date=13 June 2017 |work=[[PC Gamer]] |access-date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Semblance&quot; allows the player to take the faces of living NPCs and use them as a temporary disguise, though they can only take a character's face once. The disguise drains power as the player moves, but not when they are standing still.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/09/15/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider-best-power/ |title=Evasion of the bodysnatcher in Dishonored: Death Of The Outsider |last=Meer |first=Alec |date=15 September 2017 |work=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |access-date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using Semblance on specific named NPCs may produce unique interactions. Completing the game unlocks an &quot;original game plus&quot; mode, where the player has access to some powers featured in ''[[Dishonored 2]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Displace&quot;/&gt;

During missions, the player may pick up optional &quot;Contracts&quot; at black markets, which are side missions that involve doing tasks such as assassinating another character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/08/26/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider/ |title='Dishonored' gets unleashed in 'Death of the Outsider' |last=Hardawar |first=Devindra |date=26 August 2017 |publisher=Engadget |access-date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one example, the character is tasked with killing a mime and making it look like a suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cut Loose&quot;/&gt;

==Plot==

After the events of ''[[Dishonored 2]]'', Emily Kaldwin is reinstated as empress and begins to salvage the Empire previously broken by Delilah's rule. Billie Lurk wakes aboard her ship, the Dreadful Wale, having a recurring nightmare regarding her right arm and eye. Billie has tracked down her old mentor Daud's whereabouts to a boxing club in Albarca Baths. She makes her way to Daud's location, finding that the boxing club is run by a Void-worshiping cult called the Eyeless.

Lurk witnesses Daud being restrained by a special device that cancels out his Void-given powers. She disables the device, thereby freeing Daud. Daud is happy to see Billie and asks for her help in one last job: killing the Outsider, to which Lurk agrees. On board the Dreadful Wale, Daud explains that the Eyeless are in possession of a ritual knife, a special blade that was originally used to create the Outsider thousands of years ago. Daud surmises that the blade will allow Billie to kill the Outsider. Billie is then visited by the Outsider, who gives her a cryptic message, whilst simultaneously replacing her right arm with a Void-made arm, and her eye with a special red artifact, the Sliver of the Eye. The arm gives Lurk supernatural abilities.

Billie makes her way into the city once again to investigate the leadership of the Eyeless. Upon figuring out the identities of the leaders, Billie steals two keys to a safety deposit box in Karnaca's largest bank. She is able to infiltrate the bank and steal the knife, while also discovering that one of the Eyeless' leaders attempted to abandon the group and hid important documents in the Royal Conservatory. Once Billie retrieves the knife, the Outsider appears and explains that he knows more than most, revealing that Daud had died of natural causes aboard the Dreadful Wale while Billie was on the heist, much to her dismay. She returns to the Dreadful Wale and cremates her mentor's deceased body, thus also burning down the Dreadful Wale (an anagram of 'Farewell Daud').

Billie then infiltrates the Royal Conservatory, where she finds the documents. They detail the location of a Void portal at an abandoned mine outside Karnaca. Billie travels to the mine, which is now overseen and operated by the Cult that originally created the Outsider. The Cult members discuss occult sciences while marveling at the Void creatures walking about near the dig site. Billie makes her way to the Eye of the Dead God and absorbs it, allowing her to safely enter the Void portal.

Once inside the Void, Billie makes her way to the Ritual Hold, where the Outsider resides. There she finds the Outsider, seemingly bound and immobile. Billie is then given a choice, to either return the Outsider to the mortal realm by having Daud's Void spirit pronounce the Outsider's real name to him, which turns out to be the mark that the Outsider gives, or to use the ritual knife to kill the Outsider. Either way, the Outsider is displaced, and Billie acknowledges that with the Outsider gone, the world will be changed in innumerable ways. However, the Void will continue to exist and there is no longer anybody who can decide who will gain its power.

==Development==
Dinga Bakaba, lead designer of ''[[Dishonored 2]]'', was one of the initial voices for making the ''Death of the Outsider'' standalone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cut Loose&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider-lets-players-cut-/1100-6452891/ |title=Dishonored: Death Of The Outsider Lets Players Cut Loose As It Closes Out The Main Story |last=Fillari |first=Alessandro |date=26 August 2017 |publisher=GameSpot |access-date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game removes the chaos system featured in previous games, which tracked how many characters the player killed and altered the world depending on if the player had a high bodycount.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cut Loose&quot;/&gt; Developers felt that removing the need to find elixirs, which were previously required to fully restore energy, encouraged players to experiment more with the full range of powers. Giving all the powers at once was &quot;liberating&quot; for Arkane, as they knew the full extent of what any player could do at any point in the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;End&quot;/&gt; Time restraints meant that levels couldn't all be &quot;themed&quot; in the same way ''Dishonored 2''{{'}}s levels were, though some levels are intended to make the player rely on different powers than others.&lt;ref name=&quot;End&quot;/&gt; Co-creative director Harvey Smith had immediate concerns about the semblance power when it was first pitched, as he felt implementing the idea appropriately would take an excessive amount of work; ultimately the full extent and ramifications of the power were reduced to more &quot;manageable&quot; levels, and Smith was glad for its inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/dishonored-2/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider-semblance |title=Dishonored: Death of the Outsider delivers on the social stealth we were promised a decade ago |last=Peel |first=Jeremy |date=29 August 2017 |publisher=PCGamesN |access-date=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Death of the Outsider'' is meant to bring an end to &quot;the Kaldwin era&quot;, an arc that began in the first ''[[Dishonored]]'' with the assassination of Jessamine Kaldwin and followed characters involved with it, such as [[Corvo Attano]] and [[Emily Kaldwin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;End&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2017/08/23/gamescom-2017-why-death-of-the-outsider-is-the-end-of-dishonored-as-we-know-it |title=Gamescom 2017: Why Death of the Outsider is the End of Dishonored as We Know It |last=O'Brien |first=Lucy |date=23 August 2017 |publisher=IGN |access-date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether any future ''Dishonored'' games will be made is undecided, but would feature different characters as their protagonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2017/08/25/quakecon-2017-future-dishonored-games-would-feature-different-characters |title=Quakecon 2017: Future Dishonored Games Would Feature Different Characters |last=Osborn |first=Alex |date=25 August 2017 |publisher=IGN |access-date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}
[[IGN]]'s Tom Marks considered it &quot;a worthy end&quot;, but felt it didn't reach the &quot;high bar&quot; of ''Dishonored 2''. Marks praised the &quot;wonderfully detailed&quot; levels and the encouragement to use abilities more liberally, though expressed mixed feelings at the removal of the Chaos system and lack of character progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/16/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider-review |title=Dishonored: Death of the Outsider Review |last=Marks |first=Tom |date=16 September 2017 |work=IGN |accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alessandro Fillari at [[GameSpot]] gave the game a positive review, praising the level design and individual missions, while also criticizing the story, stating that &quot;while starting strong, the story eventually runs out of steam.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;game_spot&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider-review/1900-6416761/ |title=Dishonored: Death of the Outsider Review |last=Fillari |first=Alessandro |date=18 September 2017 |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive Inc.]] |accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''The Vanishing of Ethan Carter'' is set in an [[open world]] environment, in which the player can roam around and explore at will. The player can use paranormal abilities in order to solve crimes, such as sensing where important objects are located and reassembling the timeline of events tied to a certain death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=The Vanishing of Ethan Carter |developer=The Astronauts |publisher=The Astronauts |date=September 26, 2014 |platform=[[Microsoft Windows]] |version= |scene= |level= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Paranormal investigator Paul Prospero receives a fan letter from 12-year old Ethan Carter, inspiring him to journey to Ethan's hometown of Red Creek Valley, Wisconsin. Upon arrival, he begins encountering unsettling paranormal phenomena, as well as evidence of recent violence in the tiny mining village.

As his investigation progresses, Prospero learns the Carter family's dark secret: Ethan had released a malevolent spirit known as the Sleeper, threatening their lives. When his uncle and mother tried to sacrifice him to appease the Sleeper, Ethan escaped with the help of his father, who committed suicide in an effort to not become a vessel of the Sleeper as Ethan's older brother Travis now was. Travis turns on Ethan, forcing his grandfather Ed to kill Travis. Ethan and Ed try to destroy the Sleeper's chambers, but Ed traps Ethan inside the chamber and waits to die outside as Ethan sets a fire within. Prospero finds Ethan, but he suddenly vanishes after they both realise Prospero was too late.

Using an elaborate mural created by Ethan, Prospero discovers that he is in fact a figment of Ethan's imagination. The cult of the Sleeper was an invention, as were the deaths of the family members during Prospero's investigation. Ethan had built a sanctuary inside a mansion in town to escape his family, particularly his overbearing mother, and abusive brother and uncle. When his mother accidentally sets the mansion on fire, trapping Ethan in the room with no way to save himself, he summons Prospero to provide comfort as he's consumed by the smoke by enacting a fictitious series of events. Having fulfilled his purpose, Prospero tells Ethan to let go, and that a new story awaits before both of them fade from the world.

==Development==

The game was developed by three former [[People Can Fly]] employees, who had previously, with the company, worked on [[first-person shooter]] video games. The team was interested in moving into more story heavy games. They almost released one, titled ''Come Midnight'', as a collaboration with [[THQ]], although ultimately this was canceled. Upon forming their own company, The Astronauts, the team had the freedom they needed to work on such a game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gameafterwards&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reeves|first1=Ben|title=Afterwords – The Vanishing of Ethan Carter|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/10/24/afterwords-the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter.aspx|website=Game Informer|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the start the game was always going to be focused on horror. In dissecting the genre, lead designer, Adrian Chmielarz, discovered the genre of [[weird fiction]] and from there the story &quot;[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]&quot; which he took inspiration from. Although he stated that he had the basic idea in mind prior to reading it, the story helped certify the concept in Chimelarz mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gameafterwards&quot;/&gt;
 
Feeling that settings in games inherently felt &quot;a bit artificial&quot;, the team instead were inspired by nature to create a more natural-feeling world. The setting in particular takes inspiration from the Polish [[Karkonosze]] mountains with Chimelarz describing the game as being &quot;shot&quot; there. The team used [[photogrammetry]] technology in order to create the in game environment and make it look like the mountain range.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gameafterwards&quot;/&gt;

==Reception==

'''''Superjail!''''' is an American [[Adult animation|adult animated]] [[television series]] produced by [[Augenblick Studios]] in its first season, and by [[Titmouse, Inc.]] in its second, third, and fourth seasons. The series follows the events that take place in an unusual [[prison]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Lloyd, Robert | title=Animation for adult eyes only | work=The Los Angeles Times | pages=E-15| date=September 27, 2008 | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/sep/27/entertainment/et-timsuperjail27 | accessdate=2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Television pilot|pilot episode]] aired on television on May 13, 2007, and its first season began on September 28, 2008 on [[Adult Swim]]. ''Superjail!'' is characterized by its [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] shifts in [[setting (fiction)|setting]] and [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and extreme [[graphic violence]], which give the series a [[TV-MA]]-V (for graphic violence, including scenes of bloodshed, dismemberment, torture, and extreme cruelty) rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://multichannel.com/news/content/adult-swim-test-friday-waters/366936 | author=Reynolds, Mike | title=Adult Swim to Test Friday Waters | work=Multichannel News | date=April 26, 2007 | accessdate=2014-04-29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These elements are depicted through highly elaborate animated sequences, which have been described as &quot;[[Baroque]] and complicated and hard to take in at a single viewing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/sep/27/entertainment/et-timsuperjail27 | author=Lloyd, Robert | title=Animation for adult eyes only | work=Los Angeles Times | date=September 27, 2008 | accessdate=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 30, 2015, Titmouse confirmed at their panel at [[Comikaze Expo]] that ''Superjail!'' had been cancelled by drawing it along with previously cancelled shows like ''[[Motorcity]]'', ''[[Tron: Uprising]]'', and ''[[Metalocalypse]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The series was the creation of [[Christy Karacas]], who was a member of the band [[Cheeseburger (band)|Cheeseburger]], and also directed ''[[Robotomy]]'' for [[Cartoon Network]], Stephen Warbrick, who was originally a digital artist on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]'' and was also an animatic artist at [[Blue Sky Studios]], and Ben Gruber, who originally wrote for [[Ultracity 6060]] on MTV's ''[[Cartoon Sushi]]'', and would also later write for shows like ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'', ''[[Breadwinners (TV series)|Breadwinners]]'', and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.

Karacas originally created a student film in 1997 for MTV's ''Cartoon Sushi'', entitled &quot;Space War&quot;. He then partnered with Stephen Warbrick in 2001, creating another film known as &quot;Bar Fight&quot;, which caught the attention of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, who allowed them, and Ben Gruber, to create a show of their own.

==Setting and premise==
The majority of ''Superjail!'' is set inside the [[eponym]]ous prison, located in an alternate dimension identified as &quot;5612&quot;. Externally, Superjail is built underneath a [[volcano]] which is itself located inside of a larger volcano. Internally, it seems to constitute its own [[parallel universe (fiction)|reality]], where the fabric of time and space is extremely fluid and changes at the whim of the Warden. It has been indicated that the prison itself has a degree of sentience, and that the nature of the prison is fluid according to the perceptions of the individual. Superjail's inmate population is stated by Jared to be in excess of 70,000, although the show's creators mention that the jail processes &quot;billions of inmates&quot;. Superjail is overseen by an individual known only as &quot;The Warden,&quot; an amiable psychopath with apparently magical powers who uses the prison (and prisoners) to satisfy his numerous whims.

In the first season, each episode begins with a linear story revolving around an irresponsible scheme concocted by the Warden to satisfy some personal desire. The episode builds up in both [[violence]] and [[surrealism]] into a climactic, [[psychedelia|psychedelic]] [[mass murder|blood bath]] during which dozens of inmates are brutally or gruesomely murdered, either by one another or some external force. Some episode plots have no resolutions at all, with the story simply stopping when events have reached their most chaotic. Regardless, the status quo is always restored by the next episode unless the episode is a multi-part one.

Beginning with the second season, the creators modified the format of the series to focus more on character development and story, as imagined by a revised writing staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geek-news.mtv.com/2011/04/01/going-back-to-superjail-with-series-creators-christy-karacas-and-stephen-warbrick/ Going Back to 'Superjail!']&lt;/ref&gt; The second-season premiere &quot;Best Friends Forever&quot; demonstrated an immediate break from the first season's template, focusing the episode on Jailbot and Jacknife as opposed to the Warden, setting half of the episode outside of the prison, and lacking an extended murder sequence in the climax.

The third season of the show attempted to meld the formats of the first two seasons, continuing a focus on character development and ongoing storylines while reviving the technique of ending each episode with a complex murder sequence.&lt;ref name=cartoon&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.bcdb.com/announces-largest-programming-schedule-4241/|title=AS Announces Largest Programming Schedule Ever|first=Ethan|last=Minovitz|publisher=Big Cartoon News|date=May 25, 2012|accessdate=May 25, 2012|df=}}{{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theme song==
The theme song for the show is &quot;Comin' Home&quot; sung by the group [[Cheeseburger (band)|Cheeseburger]]. An acoustic version (also sung by Cheeseburger) can be heard as the opening to the episode &quot;Time Police Part 2&quot;, when, after the shutdown of Superjail, Jacknife is sent to a real-world prison after attempting to rob a bank (this scene could also be a flashback, as Jacknife already had been in a real-life prison at the beginning of the pilot episode, &quot;Bunny Love&quot;). The song is used in every episode except for two: &quot;Bunny Love&quot; and &quot;The Budding of the Warbuxx&quot;. &quot;Bunny Love&quot; opens with &quot;[[Rubber Bullets]]&quot; by [[10cc]] (which was supposed to be the show's theme song originally, but was changed, as the song's rights were too expensive for the show to use), and &quot;The Budding of the Warbuxx&quot; has no opening song.

Starting from Season four, the episodes' pre-opening sequences no longer feature the &quot;Comin' Home&quot; theme.

==Characters==

===Main characters===
* '''The Warden''' (voiced by [[David Wain]]) – The proprietor and [[Prison warden|warden]] of Superjail and the main character of the series. A tall, thin man clad in a [[purple]] [[tailcoat]] and top hat, gloves, [[red]] [[cummerbund]], and [[yellow]]-[[tinted glasses]], the Warden has been described as a &quot;[[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] version of both the [[Mad Hatter]] from ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' and [[Willy Wonka]] from ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/google/20070426006382/en|title=Adult Swim Announces 2007 Programming Slate at New York Upfront |accessdate=2008-10-16|date=2008-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he possesses an ever-cheerful and optimistic demeanor, he is a severely deranged and violent individual due to his upbringing by a strict father who was also a warden. The Warden devised Superjail as a means for expressing himself and regularly endangers the lives of Superjail prisoners and staff, often intentionally, to satisfy some unusual whim. He has very little respect for human life, and one day wishes to incarcerate all of humanity within the Superjail, according to one episode depicting an alternate future where he conquers the entire world and transforms it into a single [[police state|prison state]]. Rather than handling any actual administrative tasks, he spends most of his time [[lust]]ing after chief guard Alice or indulging his own bizarre  [[fantasy|fantasies]].  The Warden also possesses magical abilities, such as the ability to [[shapeshifting|shapeshift]] into virtually anything he can imagine, and the ability to control the laws of reality within Superjail. Though the Warden's name is never revealed, David Wain answered &quot;Mark Davis&quot; to a user on [[Reddit]].
* '''Jared''' (voiced by Teddy Cohn) – Superjail's large-headed, long-moustached, uptight/high-strung [[accountant]] and the Warden's primary assistant. Jared handles most of Superjail's administrative duties as well as extracurricular activities, such as the Superjail Newspaper. He was first taken to Superjail as a prisoner for unknowingly working for the [[American mafia|mafia]] and got his job when he impressed the Warden with his [[intelligence]] and financial skills (An allusion to ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]''). He is in recovery for, according to the show's creators, every addiction possible, including [[alcoholism]], [[substance dependence|drug addiction]], [[gambling]], and [[compulsive overeating|compulsive eating]]. Periodically, Jared suffers relapses into his addictions, especially when he is stressed out or temptation proves to be too much for him.
* '''Alice''' (voiced by [[Christy Karacas]]) – The hulking, muscular head [[Prison officer|prison guard]] of Superjail who is [[transgender]] and regularly engages in [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] rituals with the prisoners (often without their consent), though she rebuffs the Warden's constant advances. She was originally a male guard at a normal prison, but discovered her true nature when she fell in love with that prison's homosexual warden. However, she was fired as a result of the prison's warden transphobia and was hired by the Warden shortly after.&lt;ref name=&quot;G4AOTS&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Colfax| first = Ty| title = 'Superjail' Creators| work = Attack of the Show| publisher = G4 TV| date = 2009-02-27| url = http://g4tv.com/attackoftheshow/moviesandtv/66330/Superjail-Creators.html| accessdate = 2009-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alice doesn't seem to take hormone therapy, but does have breast implants and publicly considers herself a woman. It is apparent throughout the show that she has not undergone gender reassignment surgery.
* '''Jailbot''' – A [[headstone|tombstone]]-shaped [[levitation|levitating]] [[robot]] that the Warden created to perform tasks in and around Superjail. Within his simplistic-looking body seems to be a [[Hammerspace|limitless storage space]], from which he can produce a vast arsenal of deadly weaponry and tools, as well as numerous [[Telescoping (mechanics)|telescoping arms]]. At the beginning of every episode Jailbot is tasked with capturing (and beating up) a criminal named Jackknife and bringing him to Superjail, often maiming or killing many innocent bystanders in the process. In the episode &quot;Jailbot 2.0&quot;, the Warden claims that Jailbot single-handedly built the vast prison, but flashbacks suggest that Jailbot is really the latest in a series of similar robots. He is [[muteness|mute]], with a [[dot matrix]] screen that displays a [[emoticon|simple expressive face]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cold Hard Flash&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coldhardflash.com/2008/09/superjail-super-interview.html|title=Superjail Super Interview|accessdate=2008-10-16|date=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his ruthlessness, Jailbot also possesses a childlike personality, protecting the Warden from any harm and watching out for the welfare of young children who come across his path, however, he can be cold and ruthless to children who are mean to him; Christy Karacas described him as a &quot;red headed stepchild... seeking approval.&quot; He has even shown compassion for Jacknife, such as releasing him in &quot;Best Friends Forever&quot;.&lt;ref name=G4AOTS /&gt;
* '''The Doctor''' (voiced by [[Christopher McCulloch]]) – The resident physician of Superjail. He regularly experiments on the inmates in grotesque ways, and has a [[German language|German accent]], but at times says words in [[French language|French]]. It was revealed in &quot;Vacation&quot; that he fought in [[World War II]] and was at one point a POW.
* '''The Twins''' (voiced by Richard Mather) – Two green-[[blood]]ed, blonde, [[twin#Monozygotic (&quot;identical&quot;) twins|identical twin]] [[extraterrestrial life|alien]]s with [[Europe]]an-sounding accents who inhabit a laboratory underneath Superjail and wear outfits resembling those worn by the Sandmen in ''[[Logan's Run (film)|Logan's Run]]''. They took a [[gap year|year abroad]] trip to Earth and then decided to stay much to their father's chagrin. Their on-screen appearances are accompanied by [[techno|techno music]]. The Twins use their alien powers—including [[teleportation]], shrinking, and materializing various items to interfere with the Warden's plans for their amusement. Although their plots often result in mass death and destruction, the Twins do not appear to harbor any malice towards either the Warden or the prisoners.
* '''Jackknife''' (voiced by Christy Karacas) – A low-level [[crime|criminal]] who appears in the openings of most episodes committing crimes before getting captured (and beaten up) by Jailbot, where his subsequent journey back to Superjail makes up the opening credits sequence. He is often depicted escaping the jail during the [[murder]] sequences in the first season and periodically throughout seasons two and three. He never speaks and communicates only by way of [[animal]]istic grunts and shrieks. He is labeled by Jared to be Superjail's most vile inmate due to his upbringing and near lack of any form of morality. Jacknife is depicted as being short-tempered, violent, and misogynistic. During the events of ''Oedipus Mess'', Jacknife is revealed to have sired a son with one of Ultra-Prison's inmates. Having recognized the child as his, Jacknife escaped while the Warden created 1,000 clones of Jacknife that run amok worldwide until all but the original are killed off. In the Season 3 premiere a female version of Jacknife causes chaos at a male strip club, and is later sent to UltraPrison, suggesting that Jacknife either has a sister or a wife.
* '''Lord Stingray''' (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]) – A [[stereotype|stereotypical]] [[supervillain]] character, akin to [[Cobra Commander]], and the main antagonist of the show. After being defeated by his [[G.I. Joe|army-themed]] enemies, he crash-landed on Superjail Island and tried to take it over, but ended up being imprisoned. He has been a thorn in the Warden's side ever since by trying to either escape or take over Superjail. Lord Stingray first appears in the second season.

===Recurring characters===
* '''Gary''' and '''Bird''' – Gary is a silent, bespectacled man obviously based on [[Robert Franklin Stroud]], the Birdman of Alcatraz. However, Gary is mostly a servant to Bird, a small female [[Atlantic canary|canary]], who appears to be the unofficial &quot;boss&quot; of all of the prisoners in Superjail until Lord Stingray got imprisoned. In the episode ''Uh Oh, It's Magic'', Gary uses his ventriloquism to throw his voice into the Warden's puppet Prison Peedee to stage a break-out. However, the plan is foiled prior to Gary's vocal cords being surgically removed and discarded.
* '''Paul Guaye''' and '''Jean Baptiste Le Ghei''' (portrayed by [[Christopher McCulloch]], Stephen Warbrick) – Two homosexual inmates that can be seen in nearly every episode. They were the leaders of the rival &quot;Purple Pythons&quot; (Jean) and &quot;Double Rainbow&quot; (Paul) [[prison gang]]s in Superjail, which parodies the 1961 musical ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]''. They fell in love as a result and eventually got married. Paul is depicted as being the more feminine of the couple and is somewhat controlling of Jean. Jean is more of the stereotypical male. Despite being violent criminals, the two of them are actually somewhat kind and caring towards others and are respected by the other inmates.
* '''Ash''' (voiced by [[Christopher McCulloch]]) – A [[Freddy Krueger|severely burned]] [[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]] [[pyromania]]c prisoner. His burns come from a fire caused by his father, a [[alcohol intoxication|drunk]], dropping a [[cigarette]] in a movie theater. Ash's personality is almost childlike.
* '''Fatty''' (voiced by Stephen Warbrick) – A bald, middle-aged, overweight inmate with a high-pitched voice and giggly/creepy personality, with an affinity for trying to show off his genitals, usually towards Gary. It is revealed in the episode &quot;Superjail Grand Prix&quot; that Fatty is a pedophile. Fatty is often killed during the murder scene or at some point in any episode he appears in, only to be inexplicably revived for the next episode.
* '''Peedee''' (voiced by [[Dana Snyder]]) – A live [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist's dummy]] possessed by Gary's voice box. Originally, he was controlled by Gary and Bird, but his character has been somewhat changed to a foul-mouthed ghostly criminal with a mobster accent and a standard criminal inmate status. He shares a rivalry with Lord Stingray, but the two occasionally work together against the Warden and the other inmates.
* '''The Mistress''' (voiced by Sally Donovan) – The female warden of Ultra-Prison (a women's prison). She had a brief one-night stand with the Warden while under the effects of [[Spanish fly]]. In the season 2 finale, she takes control of Superjail. She engaged in a relationship with Lord Stingray in the season 3 episode &quot;Stingstress&quot;. However, after a night of intercourse with Alice, the Mistress returns Superjail to the Warden while she begins a new life-style as a [[hippie]].
*'''Bruce''' (voiced by Melissa Brown (Ladies' Night) and Chris McCulloch or Stephen Warbrick (Stingstress)) – the head guard at Ultraprison and part of the Mistress' staff. He is the opposite counterpart to Alice, and is thus also transgender.
*'''Nova''' (voiced by Sally Donovan) – the robot of UltraPrison. While she appears to be the female version of Jailbot, she is also a sleeker, refers to herself as 'newer model' than he is however since they both are custom built prototypes no one can be newer or older.
*'''Charise''' (voiced by Kamala Sankaram (&quot;Ladies' Night&quot;) and Sally Donovan in &quot;Vacation&quot; and onwards) – part of the staff at Ultraprison, acting as both Mistress' personal assistant and her accountant. She is basically the counterpart to Jared.

'''''The Lion King''''' is a 1994 American [[animation|animated]] [[Epic film|epic]] [[musical film|musical]] film produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It is the 32nd [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], and the fifth animated film produced during a period known as the [[Disney Renaissance]].  ''The Lion King'' was directed by [[Roger Allers]] and [[Rob Minkoff]], produced by [[Don Hahn]], and has a screenplay credited to [[Irene Mecchi]], [[Jonathan Roberts (writer)|Jonathan Roberts]], and [[Linda Woolverton]]. Its original songs were written by composer [[Elton John]] and lyricist [[Tim Rice]], with a score by [[Hans Zimmer]]. The film features an [[Ensemble cast|ensemble voice cast]] that includes [[Matthew Broderick]], [[James Earl Jones]], [[Jeremy Irons]], [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]], [[Moira Kelly]], [[Nathan Lane]], [[Ernie Sabella]], [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Robert Guillaume]], [[Madge Sinclair]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Cheech Marin]], and [[Jim Cummings]]. The story takes place in a kingdom of [[East African lion|lion]]s in [[Africa]] and was influenced by [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]''.

''The Lion King'' tells the story of [[Simba]], a young lion who is to succeed his father, Mufasa, as King of the Pride Lands; however, after Simba's uncle Scar (Mufasa's jealous younger brother), murders Mufasa, Simba is manipulated into thinking he was responsible and flees into [[exile]]. Upon maturation living with [[Timon and Pumbaa|two wastrels]], Simba is given some valuable perspective from his childhood friend, [[Nala (Disney)|Nala]], and his [[shaman]], Rafiki, before returning to challenge Scar to end his [[tyranny]] and take his place in the Circle of Life as the rightful King.

Development of ''The Lion King'' began in 1988 during a meeting between [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Roy E. Disney]], and [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]] while promoting ''[[Oliver &amp; Company]]'' in Europe. [[Thomas Disch]] wrote a [[film treatment]], and Woolverton developed the first scripts while [[George Scribner]] was signed on as director, being later joined by Allers. Production began in 1991 concurrently with ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'', which wound up attracting most of Disney's top animators. Some time after the staff traveled to [[Hell's Gate National Park]] in [[Kenya]] to research on the film's setting and animals, Scribner left production disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a musical and was replaced by Minkoff. When Hahn joined the project, he was dissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten. Nearly 20 minutes of animation sequences were produced at [[Disney’s Hollywood Studios]] theme park in Florida. [[Computer animation]] was also used in several scenes, most notably in the [[wildebeest]] stampede sequence.

''The Lion King'' was released on June 15, 1994, to a positive reaction from critics, who praised the film for its music, story, and animation. With a worldwide gross of $766 million, it finished its theatrical run as the [[1994 in film#Highest grossing films|highest-grossing release of 1994]] and the [[List of highest-grossing films|second highest-grossing film of all-time]]. It is also the [[List of highest-grossing animated films#Traditional animation|highest-grossing traditionally animated film of all-time]]. ''The Lion King'' garnered two [[Academy Award]]s for its achievement in music and the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture&amp;nbsp;– Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture&amp;nbsp;– Musical or Comedy]]. The film has led to [[The Lion King (franchise)|many derived works]], such as [[The Lion King (musical)|a Broadway adaptation]]; two [[direct-to-video]] follow-ups—the sequel, ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'' (1998), and the prequel/[[Sequel#Parallel|parallel]], ''[[The Lion King 1½]]'' (2004)—; two television series, ''[[Timon and Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon and Pumbaa]]'' and ''[[The Lion Guard]]''; and a [[3D film|3D]] re-release, in 2011.

In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. A [[computer animation|CGI]] [[The Lion King (2019 film)|remake]] of the film directed by [[Jon Favreau]] is scheduled for a July 19, 2019 release in the United States.

==Plot==
In the Pride Lands of [[Africa]], a lion rules over the animal kingdom from Pride Rock. King Mufasa's newborn son, [[Simba]], is presented to the assembled animals by Rafiki, a [[mandrill]] who serves as [[Shamanism|shaman]] and advisor. Mufasa shows young Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the &quot;circle of life&quot; which connects all living things. Mufasa's younger brother, [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]], covets the throne and plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba so he may become king. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala—to whom Simba is betrothed—into exploring a forbidden [[elephants' graveyard]], where they are attacked by three [[spotted hyena]]s who are in league with Scar. Mufasa is alerted to the danger by his [[majordomo]], the [[hornbill]] Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though angry with Simba, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba.

Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of [[wildebeest]] into a stampede that will trample him. He informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing the king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge. Scar refuses to help Mufasa, instead sending him falling to his death. He then convinces Simba that the tragedy was Simba's own fault and advises him to flee the kingdom. He orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing a large pack of hyenas to live in the Pride Lands.

Simba collapses in a desert and is rescued by [[Timon and Pumbaa]], a [[meerkat]] and [[common warthog|warthog]] who are fellow outcasts. Simba grows up in the jungle with his two new friends, living a carefree life under the motto &quot;[[hakuna matata]]&quot; (&quot;no worries&quot; in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]). Now a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reunite and fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a drought-stricken wasteland under Scar's reign. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasa' spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as king. Realizing he can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return home.

Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar. Scar taunts him over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to Simba that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame the hyenas for his actions; Simba spares his life but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to toss him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall but is killed by the hyenas, who overheard him betray them to Simba. With his enemies gone, Simba takes over the kingship as the rains begin to fall, restoring life to the land.

Later, with Pride Rock restored to its former glory, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of life.

===Development===
The idea for ''The Lion King'' was conceived in late 1988 during a conversation between [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Roy E. Disney]] and [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]] on a plane to Europe to promote ''[[Oliver &amp; Company]]''. During the conversation, the topic of a story set in Africa came up, and Katzenberg immediately jumped at the idea.&lt;ref name=&quot;memoir&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media|title=The Lion King: A Memoir&amp;nbsp;– Don Hahn|location=The Lion King: Diamond Edition |type=Blu-ray |year=2011 |publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was then developed by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]]'s vice president for creative affairs Charlie Fink.&lt;ref name=&quot;neuwirth&quot; /&gt; Katzenberg decided to add elements involving coming of age and death, and ideas from personal life experiences, such as some of his trials in his bumpy road in politics, saying about the film, &quot;It is a little bit about myself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pride&quot; /&gt; In November of that year [[Thomas Disch]] (author of ''[[The Brave Little Toaster (novel)|The Brave Little Toaster]]'') wrote a [[film treatment|treatment]] entitled ''King of the Kalahari'',&lt;ref name=&quot;LionKingDisch&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.jamescumminsbookseller.com/59/|title=The Origins of 'The Lion King'|accessdate=October 22, 2011|publisher=James Cummins Book Seller|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413145705/http://news.jamescumminsbookseller.com/?p=59|archivedate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and afterwards, [[Linda Woolverton]] spent a year writing drafts of the script, which was titled ''King of the Beasts'' and then ''King of the Jungle''.&lt;ref name=&quot;neuwirth&quot; /&gt; The original version of the film was very different from the final film. The plot was centered in a battle being between lions and baboons with Scar being the leader of the baboons, Rafiki being a cheetah,&lt;ref name=&quot;pride&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media|title=The Pride of the King|location=The Lion King: Diamond Edition |type=Blu-ray |year=2011 |publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Timon and Pumbaa being Simba's childhood friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;dvdcommentary&quot; /&gt; Simba would also not leave the kingdom but become a &quot;lazy, slovenly, horrible character&quot; due to manipulations from Scar, so Simba could be overthrown after coming of age. By 1990, producer [[Thomas Schumacher]], who had just completed ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', decided to attach himself to the project &quot;because lions are cool&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;neuwirth&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Makin' toons: inside the most popular animated TV shows and movies|first=Allan|last=Neuwirth|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc.|year=2003|isbn=978-1-58115-269-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schumacher likened the script for ''King of the Jungle'' to &quot;an animated ''[[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]]'' special&quot;.&lt;ref name=schu/&gt;

''Oliver &amp; Company'' director [[George Scribner]] was the initial director of the film,&lt;ref name=&quot;mane&quot; /&gt; being later joined by [[Roger Allers]], who was the lead story man on ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' in October 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;memoir&quot; /&gt; Allers brought with him [[Brenda Chapman]], who would become the head of story.&lt;ref name=&quot;neuwirth&quot; /&gt; Afterwards, several of the lead crew members, including Allers, Scribner, Hahn, Chapman, and production designer [[Chris Sanders (director)|Chris Sanders]], took a trip to [[Hell's Gate National Park]] in Kenya, in order to study and gain an appreciation of the environment for the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;art&quot; /&gt; After six months of story development work Scribner decided to leave the project, as he clashed with Allers and the producers on their decision to turn the film into a musical, as Scribner's intention was of making a documentary-like film more focused on natural aspects.&lt;ref name=&quot;memoir&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mattinson&quot; /&gt; [[Rob Minkoff]] replaced Scribner,&lt;ref name=&quot;art&quot; /&gt; and producer [[Don Hahn]] joined the production as Schumacher became only an executive producer due to Disney promoting him to Vice President of Development for Feature Animation.&lt;ref name=schu&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.disney.com.au/tlk/media/TLK_Media_Kit_v4.pdf|title=The Lion King: The Landmark Musical Event|year=2013|publisher=Walt Disney Company|accessdate=February 14, 2014|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hahn found the script unfocused and lacking a clear theme, and after establishing the main theme as &quot;leaving childhood and facing up to the realities of the world&quot;, asked for a final retool. Allers, Minkoff, Chapman and Hahn then rewrote the story across two weeks of meetings with directors [[Kirk Wise]] and [[Gary Trousdale]], who had just finished ''Beauty and the Beast''.&lt;ref name=&quot;art&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The art of The Lion King |author=Finch, Christopher |pages=165–193|chapter=Afterword|publisher=Hyperion|year=1994|isbn=978-0-7868-6028-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script also had its title changed from ''King of the Jungle'' to ''The Lion King'', as the setting was not the jungle but the savannah.&lt;ref name=&quot;memoir&quot; /&gt;

''The Lion King'' was the first Disney animated feature to be an original story, rather than be based on an already existing work. The filmmakers have said that the story of ''The Lion King'' was inspired by the lives of [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]] and [[Moses]], from the Bible, and [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlatinumEditionDVDOrigins&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media|title=The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 2), Origins|medium=DVD |publisher=[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]|date=June 15, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer of 1992, the team was joined by screenwriter [[Irene Mecchi]], with a second screenwriter, [[Jonathan Roberts (writer)|Jonathan Roberts]], joining a few months later. Mecchi and Roberts took charge of the revision process, fixing unresolved emotional issues in the script and adding comic business for Pumbaa, Timon, and the hyenas.&lt;ref name=&quot;LionKingProduction&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.lionking.org/text/FilmNotes.html |title=Lion King Production Notes |accessdate=August 5, 2008|publisher=Walt Disney Pictures|date=May 25, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lyricist [[Tim Rice]] worked closely with the writing team, flying to California at least once a month because his songs needed to work in the narrative continuity. Rice's lyrics—which were reworked up to the production's end—were pinned to the [[storyboard]]s during development.&lt;ref name=&quot;art&quot; /&gt; Rewrites were frequent, with animator [[Andreas Deja]] saying that completed scenes would be delivered, only for the response to be that parts needed to be reanimated because of dialog changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;neuwirth&quot; /&gt;

===Casting===
The voice actors were chosen for how they fit and could add to the characters—for instance, [[James Earl Jones]] was cast because the directors found his voice &quot;powerful&quot; and similar to a lion's roar.&lt;ref name=&quot;making&quot;/&gt; Jones commented that during the years of production, Mufasa &quot;became more and more of a dopey dad instead of [a] grand king&quot;.&lt;ref name=fone/&gt;

[[Nathan Lane]] originally auditioned for [[List of characters in The Lion King#Zazu|Zazu]], and [[Ernie Sabella]] for one of the hyenas. Upon meeting each other at the recording studio, the actors, who at the time both co-starred in ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'', were asked to record together as hyenas. The directors laughed at their performance and decided to cast them as Timon and Pumbaa.&lt;ref name=&quot;making&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media | title =The Making of The Lion King | location=''The Lion King'' [[laserdisc]]| medium =Laserdisc| publisher =[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]  |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/15/entertainment/la-et-lion-king-20110915|title=A 'Lion's' tale|first=Susan|last=King|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=September 15, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the hyenas, the original intention was to reunite [[Cheech &amp; Chong]], but while [[Cheech Marin]] accepted to play Banzai, [[Tommy Chong]] was unavailable. Thus his role was changed into a female hyena, Shenzi, who was voiced by [[Whoopi Goldberg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dvdcommentary&quot; /&gt;

[[Matthew Broderick]] was cast as adult [[Simba]] early during production, and during the three years of voice acting only recorded with another actor once, and only discovered [[Moira Kelly]] voiced [[Nala (The Lion King)|Nala]] at the premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/27/movies/at-the-movies.html|title=The Lion Evolves|work=The New York Times|first=Dave|last=Kehr|date=December 27, 2002|accessdate=April 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; English actors [[Tim Curry]] and [[Malcolm McDowell]] were originally considered for the role of [[Scar (Disney)|Scar]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:23&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title = Disney Voice Actors: A Biographical Dictionary|last = Hischak|first = Thomas S|publisher = McFarland|year = 2011|isbn = 9780786486946|location = United States|pages = 106|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=e1RTP8thtR0C&amp;pg=PA106}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Curry left the role due to ''[[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]]'', and it was ultimately won by English actor [[Jeremy Irons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.moviefone.com/2014/06/14/lion-king-facts/|title = 'The Lion King': 20 Things You Didn't Know About the Disney Classic|date = June 14, 2014|accessdate = July 11, 2014|website = Moviefone|publisher = AOL Inc|last = Knolle|first = Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irons had at first refused the role due to not being comfortable going from the dramatic performance as [[Claus von Bülow]] in ''[[Reversal of Fortune]]'' to a comedic role.

===Animation===
{{Quote box|width =33%|quote=&quot;''The Lion King'' was considered a little movie because we were going to take some risks.

The character animators studied real-life animals for reference, as was done for the 1942 Disney film ''[[Bambi]]''. [[Jim Fowler]], renowned wildlife expert, visited the studios on several occasions with an assortment of lions and other savannah inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings authenticity.&lt;ref name=&quot;art&quot; /&gt; The animators also studied animal movements at the [[Zoo Miami|Miami MetroZoo]] under guidance from wildlife expert [[Ron Magill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FilMiami's Shining Star: Ron Magill|url=http://www.filmiami.org/news_11May_Ron.asp|website=FilmMiami|publisher=Miami-Dade County|accessdate=May 24, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525015758/http://www.filmiami.org/news_11May_Ron.asp|archivedate=May 25, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pride Lands are modeled on the Kenyan national park visited by the crew. Varied focal lengths and lenses were employed to differ from the habitual portrayal of Africa in documentaries—which employ [[telephoto lens]]es to shoot the wildlife from a distance. The epic feel drew inspiration from concept studies by artist Hans Bacher—which, following Scribner's request for realism, tried to depict effects such as [[lens flare]]—and the works of painters [[Charles Marion Russell]], [[Frederic Remington]] and [[Maxfield Parrish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;art&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=66|title=Dream worlds: production design for animation|first=Hans P.|last=Bacher|publisher=Focal Press|isbn=0-240-52093-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the characters were not [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]], all the animators had to learn to draw four-legged animals, and the story and character development was done through use of longer shots following the characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;dvdcommentary&quot; /&gt;

Computers helped the filmmakers present their vision in new ways. For the &quot;wildebeest stampede&quot; sequence, several distinct wildebeest characters were created in a 3D computer program, multiplied into hundreds, [[cel shading|cel shaded]] to look like drawn animation, and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real, unpredictable movement of a herd.&lt;!--the &quot;Be Prepared&quot; sequence was done by animating a handful of hyenas by hand and duplicating them, not my using he same CGI process as the wildebeests--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 2), Computer Animation|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]|date=June 15, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five specially trained animators and technicians spent more than two years creating the two-and-a-half-minute stampede.&lt;ref name=&quot;LionKingProduction&quot; /&gt; The [[Computer Animation Production System|CAPS]] helped simulate camera movements such as [[tracking shot]]s, and was employed in coloring, lighting, and particle effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;dvdcommentary&quot; /&gt;

Lyricist [[Tim Rice]], who was working with composer [[Alan Menken]] on songs for ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', was invited to write the songs, and accepted on the condition of finding a composing partner. As Menken was unavailable, the producers accepted Rice's suggestion of [[Elton John]],&lt;ref name=&quot;making&quot; /&gt; after Rice's invitation of [[ABBA]] fell through due to [[Benny Andersson]] being busy with the musical ''[[Kristina från Duvemåla]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pride&quot; /&gt; John expressed an interest in writing &quot;ultra-pop songs that kids would like; then adults can go and see those movies and get just as much pleasure out of them&quot;, mentioning a possible influence of ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', where he felt the &quot;music was so funny and appealed to kids and adults&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Elton John: The Billboard Interview|last=White|first=Timothy|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|pages=95–96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1wkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA27|date=October 4, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the song &quot;[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]&quot; in a scene with Timon and Pumbaa led to disputes between Disney and the family of South African [[Solomon Linda]], who composed the song (originally titled &quot;Mbube&quot;) in 1939. In July 2004, Linda's family filed suit, seeking $1.6 million in royalties from Disney. In February 2006, Linda's heirs reached a legal settlement with Abilene Music, who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney for an undisclosed amount of money.&lt;ref name=&quot;undisclosed&quot;&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News|date=February 16, 2006 |title=Disney settles Lion song dispute|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4721564.stm | accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
For ''The Lion King''{{'}}s first [[film trailer]], Disney opted to feature a single scene, the entire opening sequence with the song &quot;Circle of Life&quot;. [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures Distribution]] president [[Dick Cook]] said the decision was made for such an approach because &quot;we were all so taken by the beauty and majesty of this piece that we felt like it was probably one of the best four minutes of film that we've seen&quot;, and Don Hahn added that &quot;Circle of Life&quot; worked as a trailer as it &quot;came off so strong, and so good, and ended with such a bang&quot;. The trailer was released in November 1993, accompanying ''[[The Three Musketeers (1993 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' in theaters, as only a third of ''The Lion King'' had been completed.&lt;ref name=den/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-29/entertainment/ca-62180_1_lion-king|date=November 29, 1993|author=Welkos, Robert W.|title=Will 'Lion King' Be Disney's Next 'Beast'?|work=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=April 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audience reaction was enthusiastic, causing Hahn to have some initial concerns as he became afraid of not living up to the expectations raised by the preview.&lt;ref name=den&gt;{{cite web|author=Brew, Simon|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/18284/don-hahn-interview-the-lion-king-disney-pixar-frankenweenie-and-the-future-of-animation|title=Don Hahn interview: The Lion King, Disney, Pixar, Frankenweenie and the future of animation|publisher=Den of Geek ([[Dennis Publishing]])|date=November 3, 2011|accessdate=April 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the film's release, Disney did 11 [[test screening]]s.&lt;ref name=70mm/&gt;

It also ranked 56th on their &quot;Top 100 Animation Movies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Top 100 Animation Movies&amp;nbsp;— Rotten Tomatoes |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/top_100_animation_movies |website=www.rottentomatoes.com |access-date=2016-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923072035/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/top_100_animation_movies |archivedate=September 23, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site's critical consensus reads, &quot;Emotionally stirring, richly drawn, and beautifully animated, ''The Lion King'' stands tall within Disney's pantheon of classic family films.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | title=The Lion King |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_lion_king/| accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 83 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lion-king | title=The Lion King (1994): Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS]] |accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CinemaScore]] reported that audiences gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-cinemascore-matters-box-office-225563|title=Why CinemaScore Matters for Box Office|author=Pamela McClintock|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=August 19, 2011|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave it 3 1/2 out of 4-stars and called the film &quot;a superbly drawn animated feature&quot; and, in his print review wrote, &quot;The saga of Simba, which in its deeply buried origins owes something to Greek tragedy and certainly to ''Hamlet'', is a learning experience as well as an entertainment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tlkebertreview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Ebert | first=Roger | authorlink =Roger Ebert |work=rogerebert.com |date=June 24, 1994 | title=The Lion King review | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-lion-king-1994| accessdate =April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the television program ''[[At the Movies (U.S. TV series)|Siskel &amp; Ebert]]'', the film was praised but received a mixed reaction when compared to previous Disney films. Ebert and his partner [[Gene Siskel]] both gave the film a &quot;Thumbs Up&quot; but Siskel said that it was not as good as earlier films such as ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and was &quot;a good film, not a great one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper]]| title=''The Lion King'' review|url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=1&amp;subsec=1140 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080514012002/http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=1&amp;subsec=1140 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 14, 2008 | accessdate=February 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hal Hinson of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it &quot;an impressive, almost daunting achievement&quot; and felt that the film was &quot;spectacular in a manner that has nearly become commonplace with Disney's feature-length animations&quot;, but was less enthusiastic toward the end of his review saying, &quot;Shakespearean in tone, epic in scope, it seems more appropriate for grown-ups than for kids. If truth be told, even for adults it is downright strange.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Hinson | first=Hal |work=The Washington Post|date=June 24, 1994| title=The Lion King review|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/review96/lionkinghin.htm| accessdate=August 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the film, writing that it &quot;has the resonance to stand not just as a terrific cartoon but as an emotionally pungent movie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 24, 1994|title=''The Lion King'' movie review|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1994/06/24/lion-king-0| accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Rolling Stone]]'' film critic [[Peter Travers]] praised the film and felt that it was &quot;a hugely entertaining blend of music, fun and eye-popping thrills, though it doesn't lack for heart&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Travers|first=Peter |work=Rolling Stone|date=July 14, 1994| title=''The Lion King'' movie review|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5947315/review/5947316/the_lion_king|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429201931/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5947315/review/5947316/the_lion_king|archivedate=April 29, 2008| accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] from ReelViews praised the film saying, &quot;With each new animated release, Disney seems to be expanding its already-broad horizons a little more. ''The Lion King'' is the most mature (in more than one sense) of these films, and there clearly has been a conscious effort to please adults as much as children. Happily, for those of us who generally stay far away from 'cartoons', they have succeeded.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berardinelli|first=James | publisher=ReelViews.net| title=''The Lion King'' review|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/l/lion_king.html| accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reviewers still had problems with the film's narrative. The staff of ''[[TV Guide]]'' wrote that while ''The Lion King'' was technically proficient and entertaining, it &quot;offers a less memorable song score than did the previous hits, and a hasty, unsatisfying dramatic resolution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=TV Guide| title=''The Lion King'' movie review|url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/lion-king/review/129956/| accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'}}s Terrence Rafferty considered that despite the good animation, the story felt like &quot;manipulat[ing] our responses at will&quot;, as &quot;Between traumas, the movie serves up soothingly banal musical numbers and silly, rambunctious comedy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=New Yorker|author=Rafferty, Terrence| title=''The Lion King'' movie review|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/the_lion_king_minkoff| accessdate=August 13, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218132505/https://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/the_lion_king_minkoff |archivedate=December 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

===Controversies===
Certain elements of the film were considered to bear a resemblance to a 1960s Japanese [[anime]] television series, ''[[Kimba the White Lion|Jungle Emperor]]'' (known as ''Kimba the White Lion'' in the United States), with characters having similar analogues, and various individual scenes being similar in composition to the show. Matthew Broderick believed initially that he was, in fact, working on an American version of ''Kimba'' since he was familiar with the Japanese original.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Schweizer|Schweizer, Peter]] and Rochelle Schweizer. ''Disney: The Mouse Betrayed: Greed, corruption, and children at risk'', Regnery, Washington, D.C., 1998. Chapter 11 &quot;The Lyin' King&quot;, pp. 167–168.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''The Lion King'' director, Roger Allers, claimed he was unfamiliar with the show: {{quote|The whole time I worked on ''The Lion King'' the name of that show never came up. At least I never heard it. I had never seen the show and really only became aware of it as ''Lion King'' was being completed, and someone showed me images of it. I worked with George Scribner and Linda Woolverton to develop the story in the early days but then left to help out on ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''. If one of them were familiar with Kimba they didn't say. Of course, it's possible... Many story ideas developed and changed along the way, always just to make our story stronger. I could certainly understand Kimba's creators feeling angry if they felt we had stolen ideas from them. If I had been inspired by Kimba I would certainly acknowledge my inspiration. All I can offer is my respect to those artists and say that their creation has its loyal admirers and its assured place in animation history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Andrea | last=Fiamma |title=Intervista a Roger Allers, il regista de Il Re Leone| date=December 12, 2014 |work=Fumettologica Magazine | url=http://www.fumettologica.it/2014/12/intervista-roger-allers-re-leone/2/ |accessdate =March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Co-director Rob Minkoff also stated that he was unfamiliar with it: &quot;I know for a fact that [''Kimba''] has never been discussed as long as I've been on the project... In my experience, if Disney becomes aware of anything like that, they say you will not do it. People are claiming copyright infringement all the time.&quot; He also stated that whenever a story is based in Africa, it is &quot;not unusual to have characters like a baboon, a bird or hyenas.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Robert W. |last=Welkos |title=A 'Kimba' Surprise for Disney : Movies: 'The Lion King' is a hit, but reported similarities to the Japanese-created American cartoon of the '60s are raising some questions. |date=July 13, 1994| work=Los Angeles Times| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-07-13/entertainment/ca-15117_1_lion-king | accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yoshihiro Shimizu, of [[Tezuka Productions]], which created ''Kimba the White Lion'', has refuted rumors that the studio was paid hush money by Disney but explains that they rejected urges from within the industry to sue because, &quot;we're a small, weak company.

===Sequels and spin-offs===
The first ''Lion King''-related animated projects involved the characters of Timon and Pumbaa. First, the duo starred in the animated short &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, featuring Timon singing [[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|the eponymous song]], which was released in 1995 accompanying the theatrical release of ''[[Tom and Huck]]''. The duo then received their own animated series, ''[[Timon &amp; Pumbaa (TV series)|The Lion King's Timon and Pumbaa]]'', which ran for three seasons and 85 episodes between 1995 and 1999.

&quot;'''The Lion and the Rose'''&quot; is the second episode of the [[Game of Thrones (season 4)|fourth season]] of [[HBO]]'s [[fantasy]] television series ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', and the 32nd overall. The episode was written by [[George R. R. Martin]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Writers&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://winteriscoming.net/2014/02/here-is-your-season-4-writers-breakdown/ |title=Here is your season 4 writers breakdown |publisher=WinterIsComing.net |date=February 26, 2014 |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the author of the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels of which the series is an adaptation, and directed by [[Alex Graves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;4directors&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/07/16/game-of-thrones-season-4-director-list/|title='Game of Thrones' season 4 directors chosen|work=Entertainment Weekly|last=Hibberd|first=James|date=July 16, 2013|accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aired on April 13, 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;Futon Critic&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20140307hbo02/|title=(#32/402) &quot;The Lion and the Rose&quot;|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode focuses principally on the long-awaited royal wedding between Joffrey Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell. Other storylines include House Bolton's quest to retake the North, and Bran's continued journey north of The Wall.

The title of the episode refers to the sigils of the wedding couple's respective houses – a lion for Joffrey Baratheon, who is in truth a Lannister, and a rose for Margaery Tyrell.

==Plot==
===At the Dreadfort===
Ramsay Snow sadistically hunts a young girl in the woods, with the assistance of his servant, Reek (formerly Theon Greyjoy), and his bedwarmer Myranda. When Ramsay's father, Roose, arrives at the Dreadfort with his new wife, Walda (granddaughter of Walder Frey), he asks to see Theon and chastises Ramsay for having castrated and tortured him. Roose intended to trade Theon to the Ironborn in exchange for Moat Cailin, a fortification that is preventing the Bolton army from returning to the north, which forced Roose and his party to have to be smuggled back to their own keep. Ramsay, in an effort to prove how well he has broken him, has Theon/Reek shave his face. While doing so, Ramsay coaxes Reek into admitting to Roose that both Bran and Rickon Stark are alive, as he could not find them, and burned two farm boys in their place while holding Winterfell. Ramsay also spitefully tells Reek that [[The Rains of Castamere|Roose betrayed and murdered Robb Stark]] who had once been like a brother to Theon. Despite this, a visibly emotional Reek completes his shave without harming Ramsay, thus proving his trustworthiness. Roose dispatches Locke to find and kill Bran and Rickon, because while they are alive they pose a threat to his new position as Warden of the North. Ramsay suggests that they also find and eliminate Jon Snow, who has Stark blood in him and will also likely oppose the Boltons. Roose also orders Ramsay, along with Reek, to capture Moat Cailin, implying that he will reward Ramsay by legitimizing him as a true Bolton.

===Beyond the Wall===
Bran, while using his abilities as a warg, sees through the eyes of his direwolf, Summer, and kills a doe. Awoken by the voice of Hodor, he is then reminded to use the warg abilities sparingly by Jojen and Meera, as spending too much time as Summer will cut him off from his human body. After stopping at a weirwood, Bran has a vision of the three-eyed raven, his father, dragons flying over King's Landing, and his paralyzing fall at Winterfell. In the vision he hears, &quot;Look for me, beneath the tree...north.&quot; Bran reveals that he knows where the group must go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/recap-game-of-thrones-season-4-episode-2-the-lion-and-the-rose-is-a-nice-day-for-a-westeros-wedding-20140413 |title=Recap: ‘Game Of Thrones’ Season 4, Episode 2, ‘The Lion And The Rose’ Is A Nice Day For A Westeros Wedding |publisher=[[Indiewire]] |date=April 13, 2014 |first=Katie |last=Walsh |accessdate=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===At Dragonstone===
At night, Melisandre orders several of Stannis Baratheon's subjects burned at the stake, including Lady Selyse's brother Ser Axell Florent, as a tribute to the Lord of Light. At a private dinner with Stannis, his wife Selyse, and Melisandre, Selyse expresses her disgust towards her daughter, causing Stannis to angrily defend the girl. After dinner, Melisandre speaks to Shireen Baratheon, Stannis and Selyse's daughter, about the Lord of Light and how the Seven Gods are a lie. Despite her young age and sheltered life, Shireen appears somewhat suspicious of Melisandre and cautiously talks with her.

===In King's Landing===
Jaime reveals to Tyrion his embarrassment at the loss of his sword hand. Tyrion encourages him to train his left hand and arranges for clandestine lessons with Bronn, provided he is paid. On the way to the wedding breakfast, Lord Varys informs Tyrion that the Queen knows about Shae and will soon tell their father, Tywin. Lord Mace Tyrell presents King Joffrey with a large gold goblet, and Tyrion gives him a rare book, before he is presented with the second [[Valyrian steel]] sword that Tywin had forged. Joffrey uses the sword to slice through the large book. In his chambers, Tyrion tries in vain to get Shae to leave, but succeeds only when he lies that he could never love a whore. Bronn escorts the forlorn Shae to the boat and later assures Tyrion that she has indeed left for Essos and is out of harm's way.

Before the wedding, Tywin and Lady Olenna trade barbs at one another. Olenna reminds Tywin of the debt the Crown now owes to the Iron Bank of Braavos. Jaime threatens Ser Loras Tyrell by telling him that should he wed Cersei, she would likely kill him in his sleep, and Loras retorts with an implication that he knows of Jaime and Cersei's incestuous affair. Brienne of Tarth is confronted by Cersei, who accuses her of being in love with Jaime. Margaery announces that the leftovers from the feast will be given to the city's poorest residents, earning much acclaim. Cersei, bitter at her loss of power and disapproving of Joffrey's new queen, confronts Grand Maester Pycelle and threatens to execute him if he does not leave the wedding and command the feast chefs to give the leftovers to the royal hounds instead. Tywin and Cersei are later confronted by Prince Oberyn and his paramour, Ellaria Sand. The four share a tense conversation filled with veiled insults, as well as Oberyn's note that Cersei's daughter, Myrcella, is currently being held in Dorne.

Joffrey then presents a crude play with dwarves depicting the War of the Five Kings, to the amusement of some guests but to the disgust of many others. Loras leaves in anger when his relationship with Renly Baratheon is mocked by the play. Tyrion is infuriated at the distasteful spectacle. Sansa is nearly brought to tears by the depiction of her recently deceased brother, Robb. Joffrey tries to get Tyrion involved in the play due to his size, but Tyrion refuses, instead requesting Joffrey display his own talent with a sword. Humiliated, Joffrey orders Tyrion to be his cupbearer, toying with him by intentionally dropping and kicking the goblet.

Eventually, Tyrion fills the goblet and hands it to Joffrey, who repeatedly orders his uncle to kneel, but Tyrion is defiant. Margaery defuses the situation by drawing attention to the wedding pie. As Joffrey eats the cake that Margaery gives him and drinks wine from the goblet Tyrion gave him, he begins choking. While the emergency draws the crowd's attention, court fool Dontos implores Sansa to flee with him. As Lady Olenna yells for everyone to assist the king, he falls to the ground, the clear victim of assassination by poison. Before dying, Joffrey points accusingly at Tyrion, who is examining the dropped goblet. Furious with grief, Cersei orders Tyrion arrested on charges of poisoning the king.

[[File:Edwin Booth Hamlet 1870.jpg|thumb|The American actor [[Edwin Booth]] as [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]], ca.&amp;nbsp;1870]]

'''''The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark''''', often shortened to '''''Hamlet''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|m|l|ᵻ|t}}), is a [[Shakespearean tragedy|tragedy]] written by [[William Shakespeare]] at an uncertain date between 1599 and 1602. Set in [[Denmark]], the [[Play (theatre)|play]] dramatises the revenge [[Prince Hamlet]] is called to wreak upon his uncle, [[King Claudius|Claudius]], by the ghost of Hamlet's father, [[King Hamlet]]. Claudius had murdered his own brother and seized the [[throne]], also marrying his deceased brother's widow.

''Hamlet'' is Shakespeare's longest play, and is considered among the most powerful and influential works of [[world literature]], with a story capable of &quot;seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others&quot;.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|p=74}} It was probably one of Shakespeare's most popular works during his lifetime,{{sfn|Taylor|2002|p=18}} and still ranks among his most performed, topping the performance list of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] and its predecessors in Stratford-upon-Avon since 1879.{{sfn|Crystal|Crystal|2005|p=66}} It has inspired many other writers—from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Charles Dickens]] to [[James Joyce]] and [[Iris Murdoch]]—and has been described as &quot;the world's most filmed story after ''[[Cinderella]]''&quot;.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|p=17}}

The story of Shakespeare's ''Hamlet'' was derived from the legend of [[Amleth]], preserved by 13th-century chronicler [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in his ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', as subsequently retold by the 16th-century scholar [[François de Belleforest]]. Shakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] play known today as the ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]'', though some scholars believe he himself wrote the ''Ur-Hamlet'', later revising it to create the version of ''Hamlet'' we now have. He almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor, [[Richard Burbage]], the leading tragedian of Shakespeare's time. In the 400 years since its inception, the role has been performed by numerous highly acclaimed actors in each successive century.

Three different early versions of the play are extant: the [[Hamlet Q1|First Quarto]] (Q1, 1603); the Second [[Quarto]] (Q2, 1604); and the [[First Folio]] (F1, 1623). Each version includes lines and entire scenes missing from the others. The play's structure and depth of characterisation have inspired much critical scrutiny. One such example is the centuries-old debate about Hamlet's hesitation to kill his uncle, which some see as merely a [[plot device]] to prolong the action, but which others argue is a dramatisation of the complex philosophical and ethical issues that surround cold-blooded murder, calculated revenge, and thwarted desire. More recently, [[Psychoanalytic literary criticism|psychoanalytic critics]] have examined Hamlet's [[unconscious mind|unconscious desires]], while [[feminist literary criticism|feminist critics]] have re-evaluated and attempted to rehabilitate the often maligned characters of [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]] and [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]].

==Plot==

===Act I===
The protagonist of ''Hamlet'' is [[Prince Hamlet]] of Denmark, son of the recently deceased [[King Hamlet]], and nephew of [[King Claudius]], his father's brother and successor. Claudius hastily married King Hamlet's widow, [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]], Hamlet's mother, and took the throne for himself. Denmark has a long-standing feud with neighbouring Norway, in which King Hamlet slew King Fortinbras of Norway in a battle some years ago. Although Denmark defeated Norway, and the Norwegian throne fell to King Fortinbras's infirm brother, Denmark fears that an invasion led by the dead Norwegian king's son, Prince [[Fortinbras]], is imminent.

On a cold night on the ramparts of [[Kronborg Slot|Elsinore]], the Danish royal castle, the [[Characters in Hamlet#Elsinore sentries|sentries]] Bernardo and Marcellus discuss a [[Ghost (Hamlet)|ghost]] resembling the late King Hamlet which they have recently seen, and bring Prince Hamlet's friend [[Horatio (Hamlet)|Horatio]] as a witness. After the ghost appears again, the three vow to tell Prince Hamlet what they have witnessed.

As the court gathers the next day, while King Claudius and Queen Gertrude discuss affairs of state with their elderly adviser [[Polonius]], Hamlet looks on glumly. During the court, Claudius grants permission for Polonius's son Laertes to return to school in France, and sends envoys to inform the King of Norway about Fortinbras. Claudius also scolds Hamlet for continuing to grieve over his father, and forbids him from returning to his schooling in [[Wittenberg]]. After the court exits, Hamlet despairs of his father's death and his mother's hasty remarriage. Learning of the ghost from Horatio, Hamlet resolves to see it himself.

[[Image:Henry Fuseli - Hamlet and the Ghost.JPG|thumb|Horatio, Hamlet, and the ghost (Artist: [[Henry Fuseli]], 1789)&lt;ref&gt;''Hamlet'' 1.4.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
As Polonius's son Laertes prepares to depart for a visit to France, Polonius gives him contradictory advice that culminates in the ironic maxim &quot;to thine own self be true.&quot;{{sfn|Trilling|2009|p=8}} Polonius's daughter, [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]], admits her interest in Hamlet, but Laertes warns her against seeking the prince's attention, and Polonius orders her to reject his advances. That night on the rampart, the ghost appears to Hamlet, telling the prince that he was murdered by Claudius and demanding that Hamlet avenge him. Hamlet agrees and the ghost vanishes. The prince confides to Horatio and the sentries that from now on he plans to &quot;put an antic disposition on&quot;, or act as though he has gone mad, and forces them to swear to keep his plans for revenge secret. Privately, however, he remains uncertain of the ghost's reliability.

===Act II===
Soon thereafter, Ophelia rushes to her father, telling him that Hamlet arrived at her door the prior night half-undressed and behaving erratically. Polonius blames love for Hamlet's madness and resolves to inform Claudius and Gertrude. As he enters to do so, the king and queen finish welcoming [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]], two student acquaintances of Hamlet, to Elsinore. The royal couple has requested that the students investigate the cause of Hamlet's mood and behaviour. Additional news requires that Polonius wait to be heard: messengers from Norway inform Claudius that the King of Norway has rebuked Prince Fortinbras for attempting to re-fight his father's battles. The forces that Fortinbras had conscripted to march against Denmark will instead be sent against Poland, though they will pass through Danish territory to get there.

Polonius tells Claudius and Gertrude his theory regarding Hamlet's behaviour, and speaks to Hamlet in a hall of the castle to try to uncover more information. Hamlet feigns madness but subtly insults Polonius all the while. When Rosencrantz and Guildenstern arrive, Hamlet greets his &quot;friends&quot; warmly, but quickly discerns that they are spies. Hamlet becomes bitter, admitting that he is upset at his situation but refusing to give the true reason why, instead commenting on &quot;[[What a piece of work is a man|what a piece of work]]&quot; humanity is. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern tell Hamlet that they have brought along a troupe of actors that they met while traveling to Elsinore. Hamlet, after welcoming the actors and dismissing his friends-turned-spies, asks them to deliver a soliloquy about the death of [[King Priam]] and [[Hecuba|Queen Hecuba]] at the climax of the [[Trojan War]]. Impressed by their delivery of the speech, he plots to stage ''The Murder of Gonzago'', a play featuring a death in the style of his father's murder, and to determine the truth of the ghost's story, as well as Claudius's guilt or innocence, by studying Claudius's reaction.

===Act III===
Polonius forces Ophelia to return Hamlet's love letters and tokens of affection to the prince while he and Claudius watch from afar to evaluate Hamlet's reaction. Hamlet is walking alone in the hall as the King and Polonius await Ophelia's entrance, musing whether &quot;[[To be, or not to be|to be or not to be]]&quot;. When Ophelia enters and tries to return Hamlet's things, Hamlet accuses her of immodesty and cries &quot;get thee to a nunnery&quot;, though it is unclear whether this, too, is a show of madness or genuine distress. His reaction convinces Claudius that Hamlet is not mad for love. Shortly thereafter, the court assembles to watch the play Hamlet has commissioned. After seeing the [[Characters in Hamlet#the Players|Player King]] murdered by his rival pouring poison in his ear, Claudius abruptly rises and runs from the room: for Hamlet, proof positive of his uncle's guilt.

[[File:Hamlet stabs Polonius.jpg|thumb|Hamlet mistakenly stabs Polonius (Artist: Coke Smyth, 19th century).]]
Gertrude summons Hamlet to her room to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius talks to himself about the impossibility of repenting, since he still has possession of his ill-gotten goods: his brother's crown and wife. He sinks to his knees. Hamlet, on his way to visit his mother, sneaks up behind him, but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is praying will send him straight to heaven while his father's ghost is stuck in purgatory. In the queen's bedchamber, Hamlet and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind a [[tapestry]], makes a noise.

Hamlet, believing it is Claudius, stabs wildly, killing Polonius, but pulls aside the curtain and sees his mistake. In a rage, Hamlet brutally insults his mother for her apparent ignorance of Claudius's villainy, but the ghost enters and reprimands Hamlet for his inaction and harsh words.  Unable to see or hear the ghost herself, Gertrude takes Hamlet's conversation with it as further evidence of madness. After begging the queen to stop sleeping with Claudius, Hamlet leaves, dragging Polonius's corpse away.

===Act IV===
Hamlet jokes with Claudius about where he has hidden Polonius's body, and the king, fearing for his life, sends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to accompany Hamlet to [[England]] with a sealed letter to the English king requesting that Hamlet be executed immediately.

Demented by grief at Polonius's death, Ophelia wanders Elsinore. Laertes arrives back from France, enraged by his father's death and his sister's madness. Claudius convinces Laertes that Hamlet is solely responsible, but a letter soon arrives indicating that Hamlet has returned to Denmark, foiling Claudius' plan. Claudius switches tactics, proposing a fencing match between Laertes and Hamlet to settle their differences.  Laertes will be given a poison-tipped foil, and Claudius will offer Hamlet poisoned wine as a congratulation if that fails. Gertrude interrupts to report that Ophelia has drowned, though it is unclear whether it was suicide or an accident exacerbated by her madness.

===Act V===
Horatio has received a letter from Hamlet, explaining that the prince escaped by negotiating with pirates who attempted to attack his England-bound ship, and the friends reunite offstage. Two [[Characters in Hamlet#Ophelia's funeral|gravediggers]] discuss Ophelia's apparent suicide while digging her grave.  Hamlet arrives with Horatio and banters with one of the gravediggers, who unearths the skull of a [[jester]] from Hamlet's childhood, [[Yorick (Hamlet)|Yorick]]. Hamlet picks up the skull, saying &quot;alas, poor Yorick&quot; as he contemplates mortality. Ophelia's [[funeral procession]] approaches, led by Laertes. Hamlet and Horatio initially hide, but when Hamlet realizes that Ophelia is the one being buried, he reveals himself, proclaiming his love for her. Laertes and Hamlet fight by Ophelia's graveside, but the brawl is broken up.

Back at Elsinore, Hamlet explains to Horatio that he had discovered Claudius's letter with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's belongings and replaced it with a forged copy indicating that his former friends should be killed instead. A foppish courtier, [[Characters in Hamlet#Osric|Osric]], interrupts the conversation to deliver the [[fencing]] challenge to Hamlet. Hamlet, despite Horatio's pleas, accepts it. Hamlet does well at first, leading the match by two hits to none, and Gertrude raises a toast to him using the poisoned glass of [[wine]] Claudius had set aside for Hamlet. Claudius tries to stop her, but is too late: she drinks, and Laertes realizes the plot will be revealed. Laertes slashes Hamlet with his poisoned blade. In the ensuing scuffle, they switch weapons and Hamlet wounds Laertes with his own poisoned sword. Gertrude collapses and, claiming she has been poisoned, dies. In his dying moments, Laertes reconciles with Hamlet and reveals Claudius's plan. Hamlet rushes at Claudius and kills him. As the poison takes effect, Hamlet, hearing that Fortinbras is marching through the area, names the Norwegian prince as his successor. Horatio, distraught at the thought of being the last survivor and living whilst Hamlet does not, says he will commit [[suicide]] by drinking the dregs of Gertrude's poisoned wine, but Hamlet begs him to live on and tell his story. Hamlet dies in Horatio's arms, proclaiming &quot;the rest is silence&quot;.  Fortinbras, who was ostensibly marching towards Poland with his army, arrives at the palace, along with an English ambassador bringing news of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's deaths. Horatio promises to recount the full story of what happened, and Fortinbras, seeing the entire Danish royal family dead, takes the crown for himself, and orders a military funeral to honour Hamlet.

[[File:Saxo original 001.jpg|thumb|upright|A facsimile of ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], which contains the legend of Amleth]]

''Hamlet''-like legends are so widely found (for example in Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, Byzantium, and Arabia) that the core &quot;hero-as-fool&quot; theme is possibly [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] in origin.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=36–7}} Several ancient written precursors to ''Hamlet'' can be identified. The first is the anonymous Scandinavian ''[[Hrólfs saga kraka|Saga of Hrolf Kraki]]''. In this, the murdered king has two sons—[[Hroðgar|Hroar]] and [[Halga|Helgi]]—who spend most of the story in disguise, under false names, rather than feigning madness, in a sequence of events that differs from Shakespeare's.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=16–25}} The second is the Roman legend of [[Lucius Junius Brutus#Biography|Brutus]], recorded in two separate Latin works. Its hero, Lucius (&quot;shining, light&quot;), changes his name and [[persona]] to Brutus (&quot;dull, stupid&quot;), playing the role of a fool to avoid the fate of his father and brothers, and eventually slaying his family's killer, [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|King Tarquinius]]. A 17th-century Nordic scholar, [[Torfaeus]], compared the Icelandic hero Amlodi and the Spanish hero Prince Ambales (from the ''[[Ambales Saga]]'') to Shakespeare's ''Hamlet''. Similarities include the prince's feigned madness, his accidental killing of the king's counsellor in his mother's bedroom, and the eventual slaying of his uncle.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=5–15}}

Many of the earlier legendary elements are interwoven in the 13th-century &quot;Life of Amleth&quot; ({{lang-la|Vita Amlethi}}) by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], part of ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=1–5}} Written in Latin, it reflects classical Roman concepts of virtue and heroism, and was widely available in Shakespeare's day.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=25–37}} Significant parallels include the prince feigning madness, his mother's hasty marriage to the usurper, the prince killing a hidden spy, and the prince substituting the execution of two retainers for his own. A reasonably faithful version of Saxo's story was translated into French in 1570 by [[François de Belleforest]], in his ''Histoires tragiques''.{{sfn|Edwards|1985|pp=1–2}} Belleforest embellished Saxo's text substantially, almost doubling its length, and introduced the hero's [[melancholia|melancholy]].{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=66–7}}

[[File:The Spanish Tragedy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Title page of ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' by Thomas Kyd]]

According to one theory, Shakespeare's main source is an earlier play—now lost—known today as the ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]''. Possibly written by [[Thomas Kyd]] or even William Shakespeare, the ''Ur-Hamlet'' would have existed by 1589, and would have incorporated a ghost.{{sfn|Jenkins|1982|pp=82–5}} Shakespeare's company, [[Lord Chamberlain's Men|the Chamberlain's Men]], may have purchased that play and performed a version for some time, which Shakespeare reworked.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|p=67}} However, since no copy of the ''Ur-Hamlet'' has survived, it is impossible to compare its language and style with the known works of any of its putative authors. Consequently, there is no direct evidence that Kyd wrote it, nor any evidence that the play was not an early version of ''Hamlet'' by Shakespeare himself. This latter idea—placing ''Hamlet'' far earlier than the generally accepted date, with a much longer period of development—has attracted some support.{{efn|In his 1936 book ''The Problem of Hamlet: A Solution'' Andrew Cairncross asserted that the ''Hamlet'' referred to in 1589 was written by Shakespeare;{{sfn|Cairncross|1975}} Peter Alexander,{{sfn|Alexander|1964}} [[Eric Sams]]{{sfn|Jackson|1991|p=267}} and, more recently, [[Harold Bloom]]{{sfn|Bloom|2001|pp=xiii,383}}{{sfn|Bloom|2003|p=154}} have agreed. However Harold Jenkins, the editor of the second series Arden edition of the play, considers that there are not grounds for thinking that the Ur-Hamlet is an early work by Shakespeare, which he then rewrote.{{sfn|Jenkins|1982|p=84 n4}}}}

The upshot is that scholars cannot assert with any confidence how much material Shakespeare took from the ''Ur-Hamlet'' (if it even existed), how much from Belleforest or Saxo, and how much from other contemporary sources (such as Kyd's ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]''). No clear evidence exists that Shakespeare made any direct references to Saxo's version. However, elements of Belleforest's version which are not in Saxo's story do appear in Shakespeare's play. Whether Shakespeare took these from Belleforest directly or through the ''Ur-Hamlet'' remains unclear.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=66–8}}

Most scholars reject the idea that ''Hamlet'' is in any way connected with Shakespeare's only son, [[Hamnet Shakespeare]], who died in 1596 at age eleven. Conventional wisdom holds that ''Hamlet'' is too obviously connected to legend, and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|p=6}} However, [[Stephen Greenblatt]] has argued that the [[coincidence]] of the names and Shakespeare's grief for the loss of his son may lie at the heart of the tragedy. He notes that the name of Hamnet Sadler, the Stratford neighbour after whom Hamnet was named, was often written as Hamlet Sadler and that, in the loose orthography of the time, the names were virtually interchangeable.{{sfn|Greenblatt|2004a|p=311}}{{sfn|Greenblatt|2004b}}

Scholars have often speculated that ''Hamlet''{{'}}s [[Polonius]] might have been inspired by [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] (Lord Burghley)—Lord High Treasurer and chief counsellor to Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;I]]. [[E. K. Chambers]] suggested Polonius's advice to Laertes may have echoed Burghley's to his son [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]].{{sfn|Chambers|1930|p=418}} [[John Dover Wilson]] thought it almost certain that the figure of Polonius caricatured Burghley.{{sfn|Wilson|1932|p=104}} [[A. L. Rowse]] speculated that Polonius's tedious [[verbosity]] might have resembled Burghley's.{{sfn|Rowse|1963|p=323}} Lilian Winstanley thought the name Corambis (in the First Quarto) did suggest Cecil and Burghley.{{sfn|Winstanley|1977|p=114}} [[Harold Jenkins (Shakespeare scholar)|Harold Jenkins]] considers the idea that Polonius might be a caricature of Burghley is a conjecture, and may be based on the similar role they each played at court, and also on the fact that Burghley addressed his ''Ten Precepts'' to his son, as in the play Polonius offers &quot;precepts&quot; to Laertes, his son.{{sfn|Cecil|2012}} Jenkins suggests that any personal satire may be found in the name &quot;Polonius&quot;, which might point to a Polish or Polonian connection.{{sfn|Jenkins|1982|p=35}} G. R. Hibbard hypothesised that differences in names (Corambis/Polonius:Montano/Raynoldo) between the First Quarto and other editions might reflect a desire not to offend scholars at Oxford University.{{efn|Polonius was close to the Latin name for [[Robert Pullen]], founder of Oxford University, and Reynaldo too close for safety to [[John Rainolds]], the President of [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]].{{sfn|Hibbard|1987|pp=74–5}}}}

In 1598, [[Francis Meres]] published his ''Palladis Tamia'', a survey of English literature from Chaucer to its present day, within which twelve of Shakespeare's plays are named. ''Hamlet'' is not among them, suggesting that it had not yet been written. As ''Hamlet'' was very popular, Bernard Lott, the series editor of ''New Swan'', believes it &quot;unlikely that he [Meres] would have overlooked ... so significant a piece&quot;.{{sfn|Lott|1970|p=xlvi}}

The phrase &quot;little eyases&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Hamlet F1'' 2.2.337.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[First Folio]] (F1) may allude to the [[Children of the Chapel]], whose popularity in London forced the Globe company into provincial touring.{{efn|The whole conversation between Rozencrantz, Guildenstern and Hamlet concerning the touring players' departure from the city is at ''Hamlet F1'' 2.2.324–360.{{refn|''Hamlet F1'' 2.2.324–360}}}} This became known as the [[War of the Theatres]], and supports a 1601 dating.{{sfn|Lott|1970|p=xlvi}} [[Katherine Duncan-Jones]] accepts a 1600–1 attribution for the date ''Hamlet'' was written, but notes that the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], playing ''Hamlet'' in the 3000-capacity [[Globe Theatre|Globe]], were unlikely to be put to any disadvantage by an audience of &quot;barely one hundred&quot; for the Children of the Chapel's equivalent play, ''[[Antonio's Revenge]]''; she believes that Shakespeare, confident in the superiority of his own work, was making a playful and charitable allusion to his friend [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston's]] very similar piece.{{sfn|Duncan-Jones|2001|pp=143–9}}

A contemporary of Shakespeare's, [[Gabriel Harvey]], wrote a marginal note in his copy of the 1598 edition of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] works, which some scholars use as dating evidence. Harvey's note says that &quot;the wiser sort&quot; enjoy ''Hamlet'', and implies that [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|the Earl of Essex]]—executed in February 1601 for rebellion—was still alive. Other scholars consider this inconclusive. Edwards, for example, concludes that the &quot;sense of time is so confused in Harvey's note that it is really of little use in trying to date  {{italic correction|''Hamlet''}}&quot;. This is because the same note also refers to [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]] and [[Thomas Watson (poet)|Watson]] as if they were still alive (&quot;our flourishing [[Meter (poetry)|metricians]]&quot;), but also mentions &quot;[[John Owen (epigrammatist)|Owen's]] new epigrams&quot;, published in 1607.{{sfn|Edwards|1985|p=5}}

==Texts==
[[File:Hamlet.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Title page]] of the 1605 printing (Q2) of ''Hamlet'']]

Three early editions of the text have survived, making attempts to establish a single &quot;authentic&quot; text problematic and inconclusive.{{sfn|Hattaway|1987|pp=13–20}} Each surviving edition differs from the others:{{sfn|Chambers|1923b|pp=486–7}}{{sfn|Halliday|1964|pp=204–5}}

*[[Hamlet Q1|First Quarto]] ('''Q1'''): In 1603 the booksellers [[Nicholas Ling]] and John Trundell published, and [[Valentine Simmes]] printed, the so-called &quot;[[Bad quarto|bad]]&quot; first quarto. Q1 contains just over half of the text of the later second quarto.
*Second Quarto ('''Q2'''): In 1604 Nicholas Ling published, and James Roberts printed, the second quarto. Some copies are dated 1605, which may indicate a second impression; consequently, Q2 is often dated &quot;1604/5&quot;. Q2 is the longest early edition, although it omits about 77 lines found in F1{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|p=465}} (most likely to avoid offending [[James I of England|James I's]] queen, [[Anne of Denmark]]).{{sfn|Halliday|1964|p=204}}
*[[First Folio]] ('''F1'''): In 1623 [[Edward Blount]] and [[William Jaggard|William and Isaac Jaggard]] published the First Folio, the first edition of Shakespeare's ''Complete Works''.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|p=78}}

Other [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|folios and quartos]] were subsequently published—including [[John Smethwick]]'s Q3, Q4, and Q5 (1611–37)—but these are regarded as derivatives of the first three editions.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|p=78}}

[[File:First-page-first-folio-Hamlet.jpg|thumb|The first page of the [[First Folio]] printing of ''Hamlet'', 1623]]
Early [[Shakespeare's editors|editors of Shakespeare's works]], beginning with [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]] (1709) and [[Lewis Theobald]] (1733), combined material from the two earliest sources of ''Hamlet'' available at the time, Q2 and F1. Each text contains material that the other lacks, with many minor differences in wording: scarcely 200 lines are identical in the two. Editors have combined them in an effort to create one &quot;inclusive&quot; text that reflects an imagined &quot;ideal&quot; of Shakespeare's original. Theobald's version became standard for a long time,{{sfn|Hibbard|1987|pp=22–3}} and his &quot;full text&quot; approach continues to influence editorial practice to the present day. Some contemporary scholarship, however, discounts this approach, instead considering &quot;an authentic ''Hamlet'' an unrealisable ideal. ... there are ''texts'' of this play but no ''text''&quot;.{{sfn|Hattaway|1987|p=16}} The 2006 publication by Arden Shakespeare of different ''Hamlet'' texts in different volumes is perhaps evidence of this shifting focus and emphasis.{{efn|The [[Arden Shakespeare]] third series published Q2, with appendices, in their first volume,{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a}} and the F1 and Q1 texts in their second volume.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006b}} The [[RSC Shakespeare]] is the F1 text with additional Q2 passages in an appendix.{{sfn|Bate|Rasmussen|2007|p=1923}} The [[New Cambridge Shakespeare]] series has begun to publish separate volumes for the separate quarto versions that exist of Shakespeare's plays.{{sfn|Irace|1998}}}} Other editors have continued to argue the need for well-edited editions taking material from all versions of the play. Colin Burrow has argued that &quot;most of us should read a text that is made up by conflating all three versions ... it's about as likely that Shakespeare wrote: &quot;To be or not to be, ay, there's the point&quot; [in Q1], as that he wrote the works of [[Francis Bacon]]. I suspect most people just won't want to read a three-text play ... [multi-text editions are] a version of the play that is out of touch with the needs of a wider public.&quot;{{sfn|Burrow|2002}}

Traditionally, editors of Shakespeare's plays have divided them into five [[Act (theater)|acts]]. None of the early texts of ''Hamlet'', however, were arranged this way, and the play's division into acts and scenes derives from a 1676 quarto. Modern editors generally follow this traditional division, but consider it unsatisfactory; for example, after Hamlet drags Polonius's body out of Gertrude's bedchamber, there is an act-break&lt;ref&gt;''Hamlet'' 3.4 and 4.1.&lt;/ref&gt; after which the action appears to continue uninterrupted.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|pp=543–52}}

[[File:Bad quarto, good quarto, first folio.png|thumb|Comparison of the 'To be, or not to be' soliloquy in the first three editions of Hamlet, showing the varying quality of the text in the [[Bad Quarto]], the Good Quarto and the [[First Folio]]]]

The discovery in 1823 of Q1—whose existence had been quite unsuspected—caused considerable interest and excitement, raising many questions of editorial practice and interpretation. Scholars immediately identified apparent deficiencies in Q1, which was instrumental in the development of the concept of a Shakespearean &quot;[[bad quarto]]&quot;.{{sfn|Jenkins|1982|p=14}} Yet Q1 has value: it contains stage directions (such as Ophelia entering with a lute and her hair down) that reveal actual stage practices in a way that Q2 and F1 do not; it contains an entire scene (usually labelled 4.6)&lt;ref&gt;''Hamlet Q1'' 14.&lt;/ref&gt; that does not appear in either Q2 or F1; and it is useful for comparison with the later editions. The major deficiency of Q1 is in the language: particularly noticeable in the opening lines of the famous &quot;[[To be, or not to be]]&quot; soliloquy: &quot;To be, or not to be, aye there's the point. / To die, to sleep, is that all? Aye all: / No, to sleep, to dream, aye marry there it goes.&quot; However, the scene order is more coherent, without the problems of Q2 and F1 of Hamlet seeming to resolve something in one scene and enter the next drowning in indecision. New Cambridge editor Kathleen Irace has noted that &quot;Q1's more linear plot design is certainly easier […] to follow […] but the simplicity of the Q1 plot arrangement eliminates the alternating plot elements that correspond to Hamlet's shifts in mood.&quot;{{sfn|Irace|1998|pp=1–34}}

Q1 is considerably shorter than Q2 or F1 and may be a [[memorial reconstruction]] of the play as Shakespeare's company performed it, by an actor who played a minor role (most likely Marcellus).{{sfn|Jackson|1986|p=171}} Scholars disagree whether the reconstruction was pirated or authorised. It is suggested by Irace that Q1 is an abridged version intended especially for travelling productions, thus the question of length may be considered as separate from issues of poor textual quality.{{sfn|Irace|1998}}{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|pp=85–6}} Editing Q1 thus poses problems in whether or not to &quot;correct&quot; differences from Q2 and F. Irace, in her introduction to Q1, wrote that &quot;I have avoided as many other alterations as possible, because the differences...are especially intriguing...I have recorded a selection of Q2/F readings in the collation.&quot; The idea that Q1 is not riddled with error but is instead eminently fit for the stage has led to at least 28 different Q1 productions since 1881.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006b|pp=36–9}} Other productions have used the probably superior Q2 and Folio texts, but used Q1's running order, in particular moving the ''to be or not to be'' soliloquy earlier.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|pp=18–19}} Developing this, some editors such as [[Jonathan Bate]] have argued that Q2 may represent &quot;a 'reading' text as opposed to a 'performance' one&quot; of ''Hamlet'', analogous to how modern films released on disc may include deleted scenes: an edition containing all of Shakespeare's material for the play for the pleasure of readers, so not representing the play as it would have been staged.{{sfn|Bate|Rasmussen|2008|p=11}}{{sfn|Crowl|2014|pp=5–6}}

==Analysis and criticism==
{{Main article|Critical approaches to Hamlet}}

===Critical history===
From the early 17th century, the play was famous for its ghost and vivid dramatisation of [[Melancholia|melancholy]] and [[insanity]], leading to a procession of mad courtiers and ladies in [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] and [[Caroline era|Caroline]] drama.{{sfn|Wofford|1994}}{{sfn|Kirsch|1969}} Though it remained popular with mass audiences, late 17th-century [[English Restoration|Restoration]] critics saw ''Hamlet'' as primitive and disapproved of its lack of [[Classical unities|unity]] and [[decorum]].{{sfn|Vickers|1974a|p=447}}{{sfn|Vickers|1974b|p=92}} This view changed drastically in the 18th century, when critics regarded Hamlet as a hero—a pure, brilliant young man thrust into unfortunate circumstances.{{sfn|Wofford|1994|p=184–5}} By the mid-18th century, however, the advent of [[Gothic fiction|Gothic literature]] brought [[Psychology|psychological]] and [[Mysticism|mystical]] readings, returning madness and the ghost to the forefront.{{sfn|Vickers|1974c|p=5}} Not until the late 18th century did critics and performers begin to view Hamlet as confusing and inconsistent. Before then, he was either mad, or not; either a hero, or not; with no in-betweens.{{sfn|Wofford|1994|p=185}} These developments represented a fundamental change in literary criticism, which came to focus more on character and less on plot.{{sfn|Wofford|1994|p=186}} By the 19th century, [[Romanticism|Romantic]] critics valued ''Hamlet'' for its internal, individual conflict reflecting the strong contemporary emphasis on internal struggles and inner character in general.{{sfn|Rosenberg|1992|p=179}} Then too, critics started to focus on Hamlet's delay as a character trait, rather than a plot device.{{sfn|Wofford|1994|p=186}} This focus on character and internal struggle continued into the 20th century, when criticism branched in several directions, discussed in [[#Context and interpretation|context and interpretation]] below.

===Dramatic structure===
''Hamlet'' departed from contemporary dramatic convention in several ways. For example, in Shakespeare's day, plays were usually expected to follow the advice of [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'': that a drama should focus on action, not character. In ''Hamlet'', Shakespeare reverses this so that it is through the [[Monologue|soliloquies]], not the action, that the audience learns Hamlet's motives and thoughts. The play is full of seeming discontinuities and irregularities of action, except in the &quot;bad&quot; quarto. At one point, as in the Gravedigger scene,{{efn|name=gravedigger}} Hamlet seems resolved to kill Claudius: in the next scene, however, when Claudius appears, he is suddenly tame. Scholars still debate whether these twists are mistakes or intentional additions to add to the play's themes of confusion and duality.{{sfn|MacCary|1998|pp=67–72, 84}}  ''Hamlet'' also contains a recurrent Shakespearean device, a [[Play within a play|play within the play]], a literary device or conceit in which one story is told during the action of another story.{{efn|Also used in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' and ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.{{sfn|Kermode|2000|p=256}}}}

===Length===
''Hamlet'' is Shakespeare's longest play.  The [[The Riverside Shakespeare|Riverside edition]] constitutes 4,042 lines totaling 29,551 words, typically requiring over four hours to stage.{{sfn|Evans|1974}}{{efn|This compares with about two to three hours for a typical Elizajacobean play.{{sfn|Hirrel|2010}}}} It is rare that the play is performed without some abridgments, and only one film adaptation has used a full-text conflation: [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s [[Hamlet (1996 film)|1996 version]], which runs slightly more than four hours.

===Language===
[[File:Delacroix-1834-I2-QueenConsolesHamlet.JPG|thumb|Hamlet's statement that his dark clothes are the outer sign of his inner grief demonstrates strong rhetorical skill (artist: [[Eugène Delacroix]] 1834).]]

Much of ''Hamlet'''s language is courtly: elaborate, witty discourse, as recommended by [[Baldassare Castiglione]]'s 1528 etiquette guide, ''The Courtier''. This work specifically advises royal retainers to amuse their masters with inventive language. Osric and Polonius, especially, seem to respect this injunction. Claudius's speech is rich with rhetorical figures—as is Hamlet's and, at times, Ophelia's—while the language of Horatio, the guards, and the gravediggers is simpler. Claudius's high status is reinforced by using the [[Majestic plural|royal first person plural]] (&quot;we&quot; or &quot;us&quot;), and [[Anaphora (rhetoric)|anaphora]] mixed with [[metaphor]] to resonate with Greek political speeches.{{sfn|MacCary|1998|pp=84–5}}

Of all the characters, Hamlet has the greatest rhetorical skill. He uses highly developed metaphors, [[stichomythia]], and in nine memorable words deploys both anaphora and [[asyndeton]]: &quot;to die: to sleep—&amp;nbsp;/ To sleep, perchance to dream&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamlet'' 3.1.63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, when occasion demands, he is precise and straightforward, as when he explains his inward emotion to his mother: &quot;But I have that within which passes show,&amp;nbsp;/ These but the trappings and the suits of woe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamlet'' 1.2.85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; At times, he relies heavily on [[pun]]s to express his true thoughts while simultaneously concealing them.{{sfn|MacCary|1998|pp=89–90}} His &quot;nunnery&quot; remarks{{efn|name=nunnery|The &quot;Nunnery Scene&quot; is ''Hamlet'' 3.1.87–160.{{refn|''Hamlet'' 3.1.87–160}}}} to Ophelia are an example of a cruel [[double entendre|double meaning]] as ''nunnery'' was [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] slang for ''brothel''.{{sfn|OED|2005}}{{efn|This interpretation is widely held,{{sfn|Kiernan|2007|p=34}} but has been challenged by, among others, Harold Jenkins.{{sfn|Jenkins|1982|pp=493–5}} He finds the evidence for a precedent for that interpretation to be insufficient and inconclusive, and considers the literal interpretation to be better suited to the dramatic context.{{sfn|Jenkins|1982|pp=493–5}}}} His very first words in the play are a pun; when Claudius addresses him as &quot;my cousin Hamlet, and my son&quot;, Hamlet says as an aside: &quot;A little more than kin, and less than kind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Hamlet'' 2.1.63–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

An unusual rhetorical device, [[hendiadys]], appears in several places in the play. Examples are found in Ophelia's speech at the end of the nunnery scene: &quot;Th'''expectancy and rose'' of the fair state&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Hamlet'' 3.1.151.&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;And I, of ladies most ''deject and wretched''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamlet'' 3.1.154.&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars have found it odd that Shakespeare would, seemingly arbitrarily, use this rhetorical form throughout the play. One explanation may be that ''Hamlet'' was written later in Shakespeare's life, when he was adept at matching rhetorical devices to characters and the plot. Linguist George T. Wright suggests that hendiadys had been used deliberately to heighten the play's sense of duality and dislocation.{{sfn|MacCary|1998|pp=87–8}} Pauline Kiernan argues that Shakespeare changed English drama forever in ''Hamlet'' because he &quot;showed how a character's language can often be saying several things at once, and contradictory meanings at that, to reflect fragmented thoughts and disturbed feelings&quot;. She gives the example of Hamlet's advice to Ophelia, &quot;get thee to a nunnery&quot;, which is simultaneously a reference to a place of chastity and a slang term for a brothel, reflecting Hamlet's confused feelings about female sexuality.{{sfn|Kiernan|2007|p=34}}

Hamlet's [[Monologue|soliloquies]] have also captured the attention of scholars. Hamlet interrupts himself, vocalising either disgust or agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly and instead blunts the thrust of his thought with wordplay. It is not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, that Hamlet is able to articulate his feelings freely.{{sfn|MacCary|1998|pp=91–3}}

==Context and interpretation==

===Religious===
[[File:John Everett Millais - Ophelia - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[John Everett Millais]]' ''[[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]]'' (1852) depicts Lady Ophelia's mysterious death by drowning. In the play, the gravediggers discuss whether Ophelia's death was a suicide and whether she merits a Christian burial.]]

Written at a time of religious upheaval, and in the wake of the [[English Reformation]], the play is alternately [[Catholicism|Catholic]] (or piously medieval) and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] (or consciously modern). The ghost describes himself as being in [[purgatory]], and as dying without [[last rites]]. This and Ophelia's burial ceremony, which is characteristically Catholic, make up most of the play's Catholic connections. Some scholars have observed that [[Revenge play|revenge tragedies]] come from Catholic countries like Italy and Spain, where the revenge tragedies present contradictions of motives, since according to Catholic doctrine the duty to God and family precedes civil justice. Hamlet's conundrum, then, is whether to avenge his father and kill Claudius, or to leave the vengeance to God, as his religion requires.{{sfn|MacCary|1998|pp=37–8}}{{efn|In the [[New Testament]], see Romans 12:19: &quot;'vengeance is mine, I will repay' sayeth the Lord&quot;.}}

Much of the play's Protestant tones derive from its setting in Denmark—both then and now a predominantly Protestant country,{{efn|See the articles on the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein]] and [[Church of Denmark]] for details.}} though it is unclear whether the fictional Denmark of the play is intended to portray this implicit fact. Dialog refers explicitly to [[Wittenberg]], where Hamlet, Horatio, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern attend university, implying where [[Martin Luther]] in 1517 first proposed his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|95 theses]] and thereby initiated the [[Protestant Reformation]].{{sfn|MacCary|1998|p=38}}

===Philosophical===
[[File:Michel de Montaigne 1.jpg|thumb|Philosophical ideas in ''Hamlet'' are similar to those of the French writer [[Michel de Montaigne]], a contemporary of Shakespeare's (artist: [[Thomas de Leu]], fl.&amp;nbsp;1560–1612).]]

Hamlet is often perceived as a philosophical character, expounding ideas that are now described as [[relativism|relativist]], [[existentialism|existentialist]], and [[scepticism|sceptical]]. For example, he expresses a subjectivistic idea when he says to Rosencrantz: &quot;there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamlet F1'' 2.2.247–248.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that nothing is real except in the mind of the individual finds its roots in the Greek [[Sophism|Sophists]], who argued that since nothing can be perceived except through the senses—and since all individuals sense, and therefore perceive things differently—there is no absolute truth, but rather only relative truth.{{sfn|MacCary|1998|pp=47–8}} The clearest alleged instance of existentialism is in the &quot;[[to be, or not to be]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Hamlet'' 3.1.55–87.&lt;/ref&gt; speech, where Hamlet is thought by some to use &quot;being&quot; to allude to life and action, and &quot;not being&quot; to death and inaction.

''Hamlet'' reflects the contemporary [[Philosophical scepticism|scepticism]] promoted by the French [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]] [[Michel de Montaigne]].{{sfn|MacCary|1998|p=49}} Prior to Montaigne's time, humanists such as [[Pico della Mirandola]] had argued that man was God's greatest creation, made in God's image and able to choose his own nature, but this view was subsequently challenged in Montaigne's ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essais]]'' of 1580. Hamlet's &quot;[[What a piece of work is a man]]&quot; seems to echo many of Montaigne's ideas, and many scholars have discussed whether Shakespeare drew directly from Montaigne or whether both men were simply reacting similarly to the spirit of the times.{{sfn|Knowles|1999|pp=1049, 1052–3}}{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|pp=73–4}}{{sfn|MacCary|1998|p=49}}

===Psychoanalytic===
[[File:Claudius at Prayer Hamlet 3-3 Delacroix 1844.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] suggested that an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal conflict]] caused Hamlet's hesitations (artist: [[Eugène Delacroix]] 1844).]]
In the first half of the 20th century, when [[psychoanalysis]] was at the height of its influence, its concepts were applied to ''Hamlet'', notably by [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Ernest Jones]], and [[Jacques Lacan]], and these studies influenced theatrical productions. In his ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1900), Freud's analysis starts from the premise that &quot;the play is built up on Hamlet's hesitations over fulfilling the task of revenge that is assigned to him; but its text offers no reasons or motives for these hesitations&quot;.{{sfn|Freud|1900|pp=367–8}} After reviewing various literary theories, Freud concludes that Hamlet has an &quot;[[Oedipus complex|Oedipal desire]] for his mother and the subsequent guilt [is] preventing him from murdering the man [Claudius] who has done what he unconsciously wanted to do&quot;.{{sfn|Britton|1995|pp=207–11}} Confronted with his [[psychological repression|repressed desires]], Hamlet realises that &quot;he himself is literally no better than the sinner whom he is to punish&quot;.{{sfn|Freud|1900|pp=367–8}} Freud suggests that Hamlet's apparent &quot;distaste for sexuality&quot;—articulated in his &quot;nunnery&quot; conversation with Ophelia—accords with this interpretation.{{sfn|Freud|1900|pp=367–8}}{{efn|name=nunnery}} [[John Barrymore]]'s long-running 1922 performance in New York, directed by Thomas Hopkins, &quot;broke new ground in its Freudian approach to character&quot;, in keeping with the post-World War I rebellion against everything Victorian.{{sfn|Morrison|1997|pp=4, 129–30}} He had a &quot;blunter intention&quot; than presenting the genteel, sweet prince of 19th-century tradition, imbuing his character with virility and lust.{{sfn|Cotsell|2005|p=191}}

Beginning in 1910, with the publication of &quot;The Œdipus-Complex as an Explanation of Hamlet's Mystery: A Study in Motive&quot;{{sfn|Jones|1910}} [[Ernest Jones]]—a psychoanalyst and Freud's biographer—developed Freud's ideas into a series of essays that culminated in his book ''[[Hamlet and Oedipus]]'' (1949). Influenced by Jones's psychoanalytic approach, several productions have portrayed the &quot;closet scene&quot;, where Hamlet confronts his mother in her private quarters, in a sexual light.{{efn|The &quot;Closet Scene&quot; is ''Hamlet'' 3.4.{{refn|''Hamlet'' 3.4.}}}} In this reading, Hamlet is disgusted by his mother's &quot;incestuous&quot; relationship with Claudius while simultaneously fearful of killing him, as this would clear Hamlet's path to his mother's bed. Ophelia's madness after her father's death may also be read through the Freudian lens: as a reaction to the death of her hoped-for lover, her father. Ophelia is overwhelmed by having her unfulfilled love for him so abruptly terminated and drifts into the oblivion of insanity.{{sfn|MacCary|1998|pp=104–7, 113–16}}{{sfn|de Grazia|2007|pp=168–70}} In 1937, [[Tyrone Guthrie]] directed [[Laurence Olivier]] in a Jones-inspired ''Hamlet'' at [[The Old Vic]].{{sfn|Smallwood|2002|p=102}} Olivier later used some of these same ideas in his 1948 film version of the play.

In the 1950s, Lacan's [[structuralism|structuralist]] theories about ''Hamlet'' were first presented in a series of [[The Seminars of Jacques Lacan|seminars]] given in Paris and later published in &quot;Desire and the Interpretation of Desire in ''Hamlet''&quot;. Lacan postulated that the human [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] is determined by structures of language and that the linguistic structures of ''Hamlet'' shed light on human desire.{{sfn|Britton|1995|pp=207–11}} His point of departure is Freud's Oedipal theories, and the central theme of mourning that runs through ''Hamlet''.{{sfn|Britton|1995|pp=207–11}} In Lacan's analysis, Hamlet unconsciously assumes the role of [[Phallus#Psychoanalysis|''phallus'']]—the cause of his inaction—and is increasingly distanced from reality &quot;by mourning, [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]], [[narcissism]] and [[psychosis]]&quot;, which create holes (or [[lack (manque)|lack]]) in the real, imaginary, and symbolic aspects of his psyche.{{sfn|Britton|1995|pp=207–11}} Lacan's theories influenced literary criticism of ''Hamlet'' because of his alternative vision of the play and his use of [[semantics]] to explore the play's psychological landscape.{{sfn|Britton|1995|pp=207–11}}

In the ''Bloom's Shakespeare Through the Ages'' volume on Hamlet, editors Bloom and Foster express a conviction that the intentions of Shakespeare in portraying the character of Hamlet in the play exceeded the capacity of the Freudian Oedipus complex to completely encompass the extent of characteristics depicted in Hamlet throughout the tragedy: &quot;For once, Freud regressed in attempting to fasten the Oedipus Complex upon Hamlet: it will not stick, and merely showed that Freud did better than T.S. Eliot, who preferred ''Coriolanus'' to ''Hamlet'', or so he said. Who can believe Eliot, when he exposes his own Hamlet Complex by declaring the play to be an aesthetic failure?&quot;{{sfn|Bloom|Foster|2008|p=xii}} The book also notes James Joyce's interpretation, stating that he &quot;did far better in the Library Scene of ''Ulysses'', where Stephen marvelously credits Shakespeare, in this play, with universal fatherhood while accurately implying that Hamlet is fatherless, thus opening a pragmatic gap between Shakespeare and Hamlet.&quot;{{sfn|Bloom|Foster|2008|p=xii}}

Joshua Rothman has written in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that &quot;we tell the story wrong when we say that Freud used the idea of the Oedipus complex to understand ''Hamlet''&quot;. Rothman suggests that &quot;it was the other way around: ''Hamlet'' helped Freud understand, and perhaps even invent, psychoanalysis&quot;. He concludes, &quot;The Oedipus complex is a misnomer. It should be called the 'Hamlet complex'.&quot;{{sfn|Rothman|2013}}

In the essay &quot;Hamlet Made Simple&quot;, David P. Gontar turns the tables on the psychoanalysts by suggesting that Claudius is not a symbolic father figure but actually Prince Hamlet's biological father. The hesitation in killing Claudius results from an unwillingness on Hamlet's part to slay his real father. If Hamlet is the biological son of Claudius, that explains many things. Hamlet does not become King of Denmark on the occasion of the King's death inasmuch as it is an open secret in court that he is Claudius's biological son, and as such he is merely a court bastard not in the line of succession. He is angry with his mother because of her long standing affair with a man Hamlet hates, and Hamlet must face the fact that he has been sired by the man he loathes. That point overturns T. S. Eliot's complaint that the play is a failure for not furnishing an &quot;objective correlative&quot; to account for Hamlet's rage at his mother. Gontar suggests that if the reader assumes that Hamlet is not who he seems to be, the objective correlative becomes apparent. Hamlet is suicidal in the first soliloquy not because his mother quickly remarries but because of her adulterous affair with the despised Claudius which makes Hamlet his son. Finally, the ghost's confirmation of an alternative fatherhood for Hamlet is a fabrication that gives the prince a motive for revenge.{{sfn|Gontar|2013}}

===Feminist===
[[File:Ophelia - Henrietta Rae.jpg|thumb|[[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]] is distracted by grief.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamlet'' 4.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist critics have explored her descent into madness (artist: Henrietta Rae 1890).]]
In the 20th century, [[feminist literary criticism|feminist critics]] opened up new approaches to Gertrude and Ophelia. [[New Historicism|New Historicist]] and [[cultural materialism (cultural studies)|cultural materialist]] critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting to piece together its original cultural environment.{{sfn|Wofford|1994|pp=199–202}} They focused on the [[Gender role|gender system]] of [[Early modern period|early modern]] England, pointing to the common trinity of ''maid, wife, or widow'', with ''whores'' outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of ''Hamlet'' is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, can be seen as honest and fair; however, it is virtually impossible to link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait.{{sfn|Howard|2003|pp=411–15}}
[[File:Hamlet (Abildgaard).jpg|thumb|Hamlet tries to show his mother Gertrude his father's ghost (artist: [[Nicolai Abraham Abildgaard|Nicolai A. Abildgaard]], ca. 1778).]]

[[Carolyn Heilbrun]]'s 1957 essay &quot;The Character of Hamlet's Mother&quot; defends Gertrude, arguing that the text never hints that Gertrude knew of Claudius poisoning King Hamlet. This analysis has been praised by many feminist critics, combating what is, by Heilbrun's argument, centuries' worth of misinterpretation. By this account, Gertrude's worst crime is of pragmatically marrying her brother-in-law in order to avoid a power vacuum. This is borne out by the fact that King Hamlet's ghost tells Hamlet to leave Gertrude out of Hamlet's revenge, to leave her to heaven, an arbitrary mercy to grant to a conspirator to murder.{{sfn|Heilbrun|1957}}{{sfn|Bloom|2003|pp=58–9}}{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=4}} This view has not been without objection from some critics.{{efn|&quot;There is a recent 'Be kind to Gertrude' fashion among some feminist critics …&quot;{{sfn|Bloom|2003}}}}

Ophelia has also been defended by feminist critics, most notably [[Elaine Showalter]].{{sfn|Showalter|1985}} Ophelia is surrounded by powerful men: her father, brother, and Hamlet. All three disappear: Laertes leaves, Hamlet abandons her, and Polonius dies. Conventional theories had argued that without these three powerful men making decisions for her, Ophelia is driven into madness.{{sfn|Bloom|2003|p=57}} Feminist theorists argue that she goes mad with guilt because, when Hamlet kills her father, he has fulfilled her sexual desire to have Hamlet kill her father so they can be together. Showalter points out that Ophelia has become the symbol of the distraught and hysterical woman in modern culture.{{sfn|MacCary|1998|pp=111–13}}

==Influence==
{{see also|Literary influence of Hamlet}}

''Hamlet'' is one of the [[Phrases from Hamlet in common English|most quoted]] works in the English language, and is often included on lists of the world's greatest literature.{{efn|''Hamlet'' has 208 quotations in ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]''; it takes up 10 of 85 pages dedicated to Shakespeare in the 1986 ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations|Bartlett's Familiar Quotations (14th ed. 1968)]]''. For examples of lists of the greatest books, see [[Harvard Classics]], [[Great Books]], [[Great Books of the Western World]], [[Harold Bloom]]'s ''The Western Canon'', [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)#The Great Books|St. John's College reading list]], and [[Core Curriculum (Columbia College)|Columbia College Core Curriculum]].}} As such, it reverberates through the writing of later centuries. Academic Laurie Osborne identifies the direct influence of ''Hamlet'' in numerous modern narratives, and divides them into four main categories: fictional accounts of the play's composition, simplifications of the story for young readers, stories expanding the role of one or more characters, and narratives featuring performances of the play.{{sfn|Osborne|2007|pp=114–33}}

[[File:Czachórski Actors before Hamlet.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Actors before Hamlet'' by [[Władysław Czachórski]] (1875), [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]].]]

English poet [[John Milton]] was an early admirer of Shakespeare, and took evident inspiration from his work. As John Kerrigan discusses, Milton originally considered writing his epic poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667) as a tragedy.{{sfn|Kerrigan|1996|p=122}} While Milton did not ultimately go that route, the poem still shows distinct echoes of Shakespearean revenge tragedy, and of ''Hamlet'' in particular. As scholar Christopher N. Warren argues, ''Paradise Lost''’s Satan “undergoes a transformation in the poem from a Hamlet-like avenger into a Claudius-like usurper,” a plot device that supports Milton’s larger [[Republicanism|Republican]] internationalist project.{{sfn|Warren|2016|p=367}} The poem also reworks theatrical language from ''Hamlet'', especially around the idea of “putting on” certain dispositions, as when Hamlet puts on “an antic disposition,” similarly to the Son in ''Paradise Lost'' who “can put on / [God’s] terrors.”{{sfn|Warren|2016|p=379}}

[[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'', published about 1749, describes a visit to ''Hamlet'' by Tom Jones and Mr Partridge, with similarities to the &quot;play within a play&quot;.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|pp=123–6}} In contrast, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] [[Bildungsroman]] ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]'', written between 1776 and 1796, not only has a production of ''Hamlet'' at its core but also creates parallels between the ghost and Wilhelm Meister's dead father.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|pp=123–6}} In the early 1850s, in ''[[Pierre: or, The Ambiguities|Pierre]]'', [[Herman Melville]] focuses on a Hamlet-like character's long development as a writer.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|pp=123–6}} Ten years later, [[Charles Dickens|Dickens's]] ''[[Great Expectations]]'' contains many Hamlet-like plot elements: it is driven by revenge-motivated actions, contains ghost-like characters (Abel Magwitch and [[Miss Havisham]]), and focuses on the hero's guilt.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|pp=123–6}} Academic Alexander Welsh notes that ''Great Expectations'' is an &quot;autobiographical novel&quot; and &quot;anticipates psychoanalytic readings of ''Hamlet'' itself&quot;.{{sfn|Welsh|2001|p=131}} About the same time, [[George Eliot]]'s ''[[The Mill on the Floss]]'' was published, introducing Maggie Tulliver &quot;who is explicitly compared with Hamlet&quot;{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|pp=126–31}} though &quot;with a reputation for sanity&quot;.{{sfn|Novy|1994|pp=62, 77–8}}

[[L. Frank Baum]]'s first published short story was &quot;They Played a New Hamlet&quot; (1895). When Baum had been touring New York State in the title role, the actor playing the ghost fell through the floorboards, and the rural audience thought it was part of the show and demanded that the actor repeat the fall, because they thought it was funny. Baum would later recount the actual story in an article, but the short story is told from the point of view of the actor playing the ghost.

In the 1920s, [[James Joyce]] managed &quot;a more upbeat version&quot; of ''Hamlet''—stripped of obsession and revenge—in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', though its main parallels are with [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|pp=123–6}} In the 1990s, two novelists were explicitly influenced by ''Hamlet''. In [[Angela Carter]]'s ''[[Wise Children]]'', ''To be or not to be''&lt;ref&gt;''Hamlet'' 3.1.55–87.&lt;/ref&gt; is reworked as a song and dance routine, and [[Iris Murdoch]]'s ''[[The Black Prince (novel)|The Black Prince]]'' has Oedipal themes and murder intertwined with a love affair between a ''Hamlet''-obsessed writer, Bradley Pearson, and the daughter of his rival.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|pp=126–31}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is the story of the woman who read Hamlet for the first time and said, &quot;I don't see why people admire that play so. It is nothing but a bunch of quotations strung together.&quot;

===Shakespeare's day to the Interregnum===
Shakespeare almost certainly wrote the role of Hamlet for [[Richard Burbage]]. He was the chief tragedian of the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], with a capacious memory for lines and a wide emotional range.{{sfn|Taylor|2002|p=4}}{{sfn|Banham|1998|p=141}}{{efn|Hattaway asserts that &quot;Richard Burbage ... played Hieronimo and also Richard III but then was the first Hamlet, Lear, and Othello&quot;{{sfn|Hattaway|1982|p=91}} and Thomson argues that the identity of Hamlet as Burbage is built into the [[dramaturgy]] of several moments of the play: &quot;we will profoundly misjudge the position if we do not recognise that, whilst this is Hamlet talking ''about'' the groundlings, it is also Burbage talking ''to'' the groundlings&quot;.{{sfn|Thomson|1983|p=24}} See also Thomson on the first player's beard.{{sfn|Thomson|1983|p=110}}}} Judging by the number of reprints, ''Hamlet'' appears to have been Shakespeare's fourth most popular play during his lifetime—only ''[[Henry IV, Part 1|Henry IV Part 1]]'', ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' and ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'' eclipsed it.{{sfn|Taylor|2002|p=18}} Shakespeare provides no clear indication of when his play is set; however, as Elizabethan actors performed at the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]] in contemporary dress on minimal sets, this would not have affected the staging.{{sfn|Taylor|2002|p=13}}

Firm evidence for specific early performances of the play is scant. What is known is that the crew of the ship ''[[Red Dragon (1595)|Red Dragon]]'', anchored off [[Sierra Leone]], performed ''Hamlet'' in September 1607;{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|pp=53–5}}{{sfn|Chambers|1930|p=334}}{{sfn|Dawson|2002|p=176}} that the play toured in Germany within five years of Shakespeare's death;{{sfn|Dawson|2002|p=176}} and that it was performed before [[James I of England|James I]] in 1619 and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1637.{{sfn|Pitcher|Woudhuysen|1969|p=204}} Oxford editor George Hibbard argues that, since the contemporary literature contains many allusions and references to ''Hamlet'' (only [[Falstaff]] is mentioned more, from Shakespeare), the play was surely performed with a frequency that the historical record misses.{{sfn|Hibbard|1987|p=17}}

All theatres were closed down by the [[Puritan]] government during the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]].{{sfn|Marsden|2002|p=21}} Even during this time, however, playlets known as ''[[droll]]s'' were often performed illegally, including one called ''The Grave-Makers'' based on Act 5, Scene 1 of ''Hamlet''.{{sfn|Holland|2007|p=34}}

When the existing stock of pre-[[English Civil War|civil war]] plays was divided between the two newly created [[Patent theatre|patent theatre companies]], ''Hamlet'' was the only Shakespearean favourite that [[William Davenant|Sir William Davenant's]] [[Duke's Company]] secured.{{sfn|Marsden|2002|pp=21–2}} It became the first of Shakespeare's plays to be presented with movable [[Flats (theatre)|flats]] painted with generic scenery behind the [[Proscenium|proscenium arch]] of [[Lincoln's Inn Fields|Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre]].{{efn|[[Samuel Pepys]] records his delight at the novelty of ''Hamlet'' &quot;done with scenes&quot;.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|1996|p=57}}}} This new stage convention highlighted the frequency with which Shakespeare shifts dramatic location, encouraging the recurrent criticism of his failure to maintain [[Classical unities|unity of place]].{{sfn|Taylor|1989|p=16}} In the title role, Davenant cast [[Thomas Betterton]], who continued to play the Dane until he was 74.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|pp=98–9}} [[David Garrick]] at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] produced a version that adapted Shakespeare heavily; he declared: &quot;I had sworn I would not leave the stage till I had rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act.

[[John Philip Kemble]] made his Drury Lane debut as Hamlet in 1783.{{sfn|Moody|2002|p=41}} His performance was said to be 20 minutes longer than anyone else's, and his lengthy pauses provoked the suggestion by [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] that &quot;music should be played between the words&quot;.{{sfn|Moody|2002|p=44}} [[Sarah Siddons]] was the first actress known to play Hamlet; many women have since played him as a [[breeches role]], to great acclaim.{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=159}} In 1748, [[Alexander Sumarokov]] wrote a Russian adaptation that focused on Prince Hamlet as the embodiment of an opposition to Claudius's tyranny—a treatment that would recur in Eastern European versions into the 20th century.{{sfn|Dawson|2002|pp=185–7}} In the years following America's independence, [[Thomas Apthorpe Cooper]], the young nation's leading tragedian, performed ''Hamlet'' among other plays at the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia, and at the [[Park Theatre (Manhattan)|Park Theatre]] in New York.

From around 1810 to 1840, the best-known Shakespearean performances in the United States were tours by leading London actors—including [[George Frederick Cooke]], [[Junius Brutus Booth]], [[Edmund Kean]], [[William Charles Macready]], and [[Charles Kemble]]. Of these, Booth remained to make his career in the States, fathering the nation's most notorious actor, [[John Wilkes Booth]] (who later assassinated [[Abraham Lincoln]]), and its most famous Hamlet, [[Edwin Booth]].{{sfn|Morrison|2002|pp=235–7}} Edwin Booth's ''Hamlet'' at the [[Fifth Avenue Theatre]] in 1875 was described as &quot;… the dark, sad, dreamy, mysterious hero of a poem. … [acted] in an ideal manner, as far removed as possible from the plane of actual life&quot;.{{sfn|Winter|1875}}{{sfn|Morrison|2002|p=241}} Booth played Hamlet for 100 nights in the 1864/5 season at [[The Winter Garden Theatre (1850)|The Winter Garden Theatre]], inaugurating the era of long-run Shakespeare in America.{{sfn|Morrison|2002|p=241}}

In the United Kingdom, the actor-managers of the [[Victorian era]] (including Kean, [[Samuel Phelps]], Macready, and [[Henry Irving]]) staged Shakespeare in a grand manner, with elaborate scenery and costumes.{{sfn|Schoch|2002|pp=58–75}} The tendency of actor-managers to emphasise the importance of their own central character did not always meet with the critics' approval. [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s praise for [[Johnston Forbes-Robertson]]'s performance contains a sideswipe at Irving: &quot;The story of the play was perfectly intelligible, and quite took the attention of the audience off the principal actor at moments. What is the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum]] coming to?&quot;{{efn|[[George Bernard Shaw]] in ''[[Saturday Review (London)|The Saturday Review]]'' on 2 October 1897.{{sfn|Shaw|1961|p=81}}}}

In London, Edmund Kean was the first Hamlet to abandon the regal finery usually associated with the role in favour of a plain costume, and he is said to have surprised his audience by playing Hamlet as serious and introspective.{{sfn|Moody|2002|p=54}} In stark contrast to earlier opulence, [[William Poel]]'s 1881 production of the Q1 text was an early attempt at reconstructing the Elizabethan theatre's austerity; his only backdrop was a set of red curtains.{{sfn|Halliday|1964|p=204}}{{sfn|O'Connor|2002|p=77}} [[Sarah Bernhardt]] played the prince in her popular 1899 London production. In contrast to the &quot;effeminate&quot; view of the central character that usually accompanied a female casting, she described her character as &quot;manly and resolute, but nonetheless thoughtful ... [he] thinks before he acts, a trait indicative of great strength and great spiritual power&quot;.{{efn|[[Sarah Bernhardt]], in a letter to the London ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]''.{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=164}}}}

In France, Charles Kemble initiated an enthusiasm for Shakespeare; and leading members of the Romantic movement such as [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]] saw his 1827 Paris performance of ''Hamlet'', particularly admiring the madness of [[Harriet Smithson]]'s Ophelia.{{sfn|Holland|2002|pp=203–5}} In Germany, ''Hamlet'' had become so assimilated by the mid-19th century that [[Ferdinand Freiligrath]] declared that &quot;Germany is Hamlet&quot;.{{sfn|Dawson|2002|p=184}} From the 1850s, the [[Parsi theatre]] tradition in India transformed ''Hamlet'' into folk performances, with dozens of songs added.{{sfn|Dawson|2002|p=188}}

===20th century===
Apart from some western troupes' 19th-century visits, the first professional performance of Hamlet in Japan was [[Otojirō Kawakami]]'s 1903 ''[[Shimpa]]'' (&quot;new school theatre&quot;) adaptation.{{sfn|Gillies|Minami|Li|Trivedi|2002|pp=259–62}} [[Tsubouchi Shōyō]] translated ''Hamlet'' and produced a performance in 1911 that blended ''Shingeki'' (&quot;new drama&quot;) and ''[[Kabuki]]'' styles.{{sfn|Gillies|Minami|Li|Trivedi|2002|pp=259–62}} This hybrid-genre reached its peak in [[Tsuneari Fukuda]]'s 1955 ''Hamlet''.{{sfn|Gillies|Minami|Li|Trivedi|2002|pp=259–62}} In 1998, [[Yukio Ninagawa]] produced an acclaimed version of ''Hamlet'' in the style of [[Noh|Nō]] theatre, which he took to London.{{sfn|Dawson|2002|p=180}}

[[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Edward Gordon Craig]]—two of the 20th century's most influential [[theatre practitioner]]s—collaborated on the [[Moscow Art Theatre]]'s seminal [[Moscow Art Theatre production of Hamlet|production of 1911–12]].{{efn|For more on this production, see the [[Moscow Art Theatre production of Hamlet|MAT production of ''Hamlet'']] article. Craig and [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] began planning the production in 1908 but, due to a serious illness of Stanislavski's, it was delayed until December, 1911.{{sfn|Benedetti|1999|pp=188–211}}}} While Craig favoured stylised abstraction, Stanislavski, armed with his [[Stanislavski's 'system'|'system,']] explored psychological motivation.{{sfn|Benedetti|1999|pp=189, 195}} Craig conceived of the play as a [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] [[monodrama]], offering a dream-like vision as seen through Hamlet's eyes alone.{{efn|On Craig's relationship to [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Russian Symbolism|Russian symbolism]], and its principles of [[monodrama]] in particular, see Taxidou;{{sfn|Taxidou|1998|pp=38–41}} on Craig's staging proposals, see Innes;{{sfn|Innes|1983|p=153}} on the centrality of the protagonist and his mirroring of the 'authorial self', see Taxidou{{sfn|Taxidou|1998|p=181, 188}} and Innes.{{sfn|Innes|1983|p=153}}}} This was most evident in the staging of the first court scene.{{efn|The first court scene is ''Hamlet'' 1.2.1–128.{{refn|''Hamlet'' 1.2.1–128.}}}}{{efn|A brightly lit, golden pyramid descended from Claudius's throne, representing the [[Feudalism|feudal hierarchy]], giving the illusion of a single, unified mass of bodies.

On Claudius's exit-line the figures remained but the gauze was loosened, so that they appeared to melt away as if Hamlet's thoughts had turned elsewhere. For this effect, the scene received an [[standing ovation|ovation]], which was unheard of at the [[Moscow Art Theatre|MAT]].{{sfn|Innes|1983|p=152}}}} The most famous aspect of the production is Craig's use of large, abstract screens that altered the size and shape of the acting area for each scene, representing the character's state of mind spatially or visualising a [[Dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] progression.{{sfn|Innes|1983|pp=165–7}} The production attracted enthusiastic and unprecedented worldwide attention for the theatre and placed it &quot;on the cultural map for Western Europe&quot;.{{sfn|Innes|1983|p=172}}{{sfn|Innes|1983|pp=140–75}}

''Hamlet'' is often played with contemporary political overtones. [[Leopold Jessner]]'s 1926 production at the Berlin Staatstheater portrayed Claudius's court as a parody of the corrupt and fawning court of [[William II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm]].{{sfn|Hortmann|2002|p=214}} In [[Poland]], the number of productions of ''Hamlet'' has tended to increase at times of political unrest, since its political themes (suspected crimes, coups, surveillance) can be used to comment on a contemporary situation.{{sfn|Hortmann|2002|p=223}} Similarly, [[Czech Republic|Czech]] directors have used the play at times of occupation: a 1941 [[Vinohrady|Vinohrady Theatre]] production &quot;emphasised, with due caution, the helpless situation of an intellectual attempting to endure in a ruthless environment&quot;.{{sfn|Burian|2004}}{{sfn|Hortmann|2002|pp=224–5}} In China, performances of Hamlet often have political significance: Gu Wuwei's 1916 ''The Usurper of State Power'', an amalgam of ''Hamlet'' and ''Macbeth'', was an attack on [[Yuan Shikai]]'s attempt to overthrow the republic.{{sfn|Gillies|Minami|Li|Trivedi|2002|pp=267–9}} In 1942, [[Jiao Juyin]] directed the play in a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] temple in [[Sichuan|Sichuan Province]], to which the government had retreated from the advancing Japanese.{{sfn|Gillies|Minami|Li|Trivedi|2002|pp=267–9}} In the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|protests]] at [[Tiananmen Square]], Lin Zhaohua staged a 1990 ''Hamlet'' in which the prince was an ordinary individual tortured by a loss of meaning. In this production, the actors playing Hamlet, Claudius and Polonius exchanged roles at crucial moments in the performance, including the moment of Claudius's death, at which point the actor mainly associated with Hamlet fell to the ground.{{sfn|Gillies|Minami|Li|Trivedi|2002|pp=267–9}}

Notable stagings in London and New York include Barrymore's 1925 production at the [[Haymarket Theatre|Haymarket]]; it influenced subsequent performances by [[John Gielgud]] and [[Laurence Olivier]].{{sfn|Morrison|2002|pp=247–8}}{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a|p=109}} Gielgud played the central role many times: his 1936 New York production ran for 132 performances, leading to the accolade that he was &quot;the finest interpreter of the role since Barrymore&quot;.{{sfn|Morrison|2002|p=249}} Although &quot;posterity has treated [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]] less kindly&quot;, throughout the 1930s and 1940s he was regarded by many as the leading interpreter of Shakespeare in the United States and in the 1938/9 season he presented Broadway's first uncut ''Hamlet'', running four and a half hours.{{sfn|Morrison|2002|pp=249–50}} Evans later performed a highly truncated version of the play that he played for South Pacific war zones during World War II which made the prince a more decisive character. The staging, known as the &quot;G.I. Hamlet&quot;, was produced on Broadway for 131 performances in 1945/46.{{sfn|Blum|1981|p=307}} Olivier's 1937 performance at The Old Vic was popular with audiences but not with critics, with [[James Agate]] writing in a famous review in ''[[The Sunday Times]],'' &quot;Mr. Olivier does not speak poetry badly. He does not speak it at all.&quot;{{sfn|Tanitch|1985}} In 1937 [[Tyrone Guthrie]] directed the play at Elsinore, Denmark with Laurence Olivier as Hamlet and Vivien Leigh as Ophelia.

In 1963, Olivier directed [[Peter O'Toole]] as Hamlet in the inaugural performance of the newly formed [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]]; critics found resonance between O'Toole's Hamlet and [[John Osborne]]'s hero, Jimmy Porter, from ''[[Look Back in Anger]]''.{{sfn|Smallwood|2002|p=108}}{{sfn|National Theatre|n.d.}}

[[Richard Burton]] received his third Tony Award nomination when he played his second Hamlet, his first under John Gielgud's direction, in 1964 in a production that holds the record for the longest run of the play in Broadway history (137 performances). The performance was set on a bare stage, conceived to appear like a dress rehearsal, with Burton in a black v-neck sweater, and Gielgud himself tape-recorded the voice for the ghost (which appeared as a looming shadow). It was immortalised both on record and on a film that played in US theatres for a week in 1964 as well as being the subject of books written by cast members William Redfield and Richard L. Sterne. 

Other New York portrayals of ''Hamlet'' of note include that of [[Ralph Fiennes]]'s in 1995 (for which he won the [[Tony Award]] for Best Actor) – which ran, from first preview to closing night, a total of one hundred performances. About the Fiennes ''Hamlet'' Vincent Canby wrote in ''The New York Times'' that it was &quot;… not one for literary sleuths and Shakespeare scholars. It respects the play, but it doesn't provide any new material for arcane debates on what it all means. Instead it's an intelligent, beautifully read …&quot;{{sfn|Canby|1995}} [[Stacy Keach]] played the role with an all-star cast at [[Joseph Papp]]'s [[Delacorte Theatre]] in the early 70s, with [[Colleen Dewhurst]]'s Gertrude, [[James Earl Jones]]'s King, [[Barnard Hughes]]'s Polonius, [[Sam Waterston]]'s Laertes and [[Raúl Juliá]]'s Osric. [[Sam Waterston]] later played the role himself at the [[Delacorte Theater|Delacorte]] for the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]], and the show transferred to the [[Vivian Beaumont Theatre]] in 1975 (Stephen Lang played Bernardo and other roles). [[Stephen Lang (actor)|Stephen Lang]]'s ''Hamlet'' for the [[Roundabout Theatre Company]] in 1992 received mixed reviews{{sfn|Gussow|1992}}{{sfn|Guernsey|Sweet|2000|p=43}} and ran for sixty-one performances. [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] played the role with the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1965. [[William Hurt]] (at Circle Rep Off-Broadway, memorably performing &quot;To Be Or Not to Be&quot; while lying on the floor), [[Jon Voight]] at Rutgers, and [[Christopher Walken]] (fiercely) at Stratford CT have all played the role, as has [[Diane Venora]] at the Public Theatre. [[Off Broadway]], the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]] mounted an uncut [[first folio]] ''Hamlet'' in 1978 at [[Columbia University]], with a playing time of under three hours.{{sfn|Panagako|1978}} In fact, ''Hamlet'' is the most produced Shakespeare play in New York theatre history, with sixty-four recorded productions on Broadway, and an untold number [[Off Broadway]].{{efn|According to the [[Internet Broadway Database]] ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' is the second most-produced Shakespeare play on Broadway, with thirty-four different productions, followed by ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', with thirty.}}

[[Ian Charleson]] performed Hamlet from 9 October to 13 November 1989, in [[Richard Eyre]]'s production at the [[Royal National Theatre|Olivier Theatre]], replacing [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], who had abandoned the production. Seriously ill from AIDS at the time, Charleson died eight weeks after his last performance. Fellow actor and friend, [[Ian McKellen|Sir Ian McKellen]], said that Charleson played Hamlet so well it was as if he had rehearsed the role all his life; McKellen called it &quot;the perfect Hamlet&quot;.{{sfn|McKellen|Puttnam|Wax|Redgrave|1990|p=124}}{{sfn|Barratt|2005|p=63}} The performance garnered other major accolades as well, some critics echoing McKellen in calling it the definitive Hamlet performance.{{sfn|Davison|1999|pp=170–82}}

In [[Australia]], a production of Hamlet was staged at the [[Belvoir St Theatre|Belvoir Street Theatre]] in [[Sydney]] in 1994 starring notable names including [[Richard Roxburgh]] as Hamlet, [[Geoffrey Rush]] as Horatio, [[Jacqueline McKenzie]] as Ophelia and [[David Wenham]] as Laertes.

The [[Shakespeare's Globe|Globe Theatre]] of London initiated a project in 2014 to perform ''Hamlet'' in every country in the world in the space of two years.

===Film and TV performances===
{{Main article|Hamlet on screen}}
{{see also|Hamlet in popular culture}}

The earliest screen success for ''Hamlet'' was [[Sarah Bernhardt]]'s five-minute film of the fencing scene,{{efn|The &quot;Fencing Scene&quot; is ''Hamlet'' 5.2.203–387.{{refn|''Hamlet'' 5.2.203–387.}}}} which was produced in 1900. The film was an early attempt at combining  [[Sound film|sound and film]], music and words were recorded on phonograph records, to be played along with the film.{{sfn|Brode|2001|pp=117–18}} Silent versions were released in 1907, 1908, 1910, 1913, 1917, and 1920.{{sfn|Brode|2001|pp=117–18}} In the 1921 film ''[[Hamlet (1921 film)|Hamlet]]'', Danish actress [[Asta Nielsen]] played the role of Hamlet as a woman who spends her life disguised as a man.{{sfn|Brode|2001|pp=117–18}}

In 1942 [[Ernst Lubitsch]] directed a motion picture titled ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not To Be]]''. The story is a comedy about a troupe of Polish actors in the Nazi era. A key plot point revolves around the famous soliloquy. The story was remade in 1983 in a film starring (and produced by) [[Mel Brooks]].

[[Laurence Olivier]]'s 1948 moody black-and-white ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]'' won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] [[Academy Award|Oscars]], and is still, {{As of|2017|lc=y}}, the only Shakespeare film to have done so. His interpretation stressed the Oedipal overtones of the play, and cast 28-year-old [[Eileen Herlie]] as Hamlet's mother, opposite himself, at 41, as Hamlet.{{sfn|Davies|2000|p=171}}

In 1953, actor [[Jack Manning (actor)|Jack Manning]] performed the play in 15-minute segments over two weeks in the short-lived late night [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] series ''[[Monodrama Theater]]''. ''New York Times'' TV critic Jack Gould praised Manning's performance as Hamlet.{{sfn|Fox|2009}}

Renowned Shakespearean actor-directors Sir [[John Gielgud]], Sir [[Laurence Olivier]] and Sir [[Kenneth Branagh]] consider the definitive rendition of the play{{sfn|Brennan|n.d.}} to be the 1964 Soviet film ''[[Hamlet (1964 film)|Gamlet]]'' ({{lang-rus|link=no|''Гамлет''}}) based on a translation by [[Boris Pasternak]] and directed by [[Grigori Kozintsev]], with a score by [[Dmitri Shostakovich]].{{sfn|Guntner|2000|pp=120–1}} [[Innokenty Smoktunovsky]] was cast in the role of Hamlet.

John Gielgud directed [[Richard Burton]] in a [[Richard Burton's Hamlet|Broadway production]] at the [[Lunt-Fontanne Theatre]] in 1964–5, the longest-running ''Hamlet'' in the U.S. to date. A live film of the production was produced using &quot;Electronovision&quot;, a method of recording a live performance with multiple video cameras and converting the image to film.{{sfn|Brode|2001|pp=125–7}} Eileen Herlie repeated her role from Olivier's film version as the Queen, and the voice of Gielgud was heard as the ghost. The Gielgud/Burton production was also recorded complete and released on LP by [[Columbia Masterworks]].

The first ''Hamlet'' in color was a [[Hamlet (1969 film)|1969 film]] directed by [[Tony Richardson]] with [[Nicol Williamson]] as Hamlet and [[Marianne Faithfull]] as Ophelia.

In 1990 [[Franco Zeffirelli]], whose Shakespeare films have been described as &quot;sensual rather than cerebral&quot;,{{sfn|Cartmell|2000|p=212}} cast [[Mel Gibson]]—then famous for the ''[[Mad Max]]'' and ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' movies—in the title role of his [[Hamlet (1990 film)|1990 version]]; [[Glenn Close]]—then famous as the psychotic &quot;other woman&quot; in ''[[Fatal Attraction]]''—played Gertrude,{{sfn|Guntner|2000|pp=121–2}} and [[Paul Scofield]] played Hamlet's father.

In contrast to Zeffirelli, whose ''Hamlet'' was heavily cut, [[Kenneth Branagh]] adapted, directed, and starred in a 1996 version containing every word of Shakespeare's play, combining the material from the F1 and Q2 texts. Branagh's [[Hamlet (1996 film)|''Hamlet'']] runs for just over four hours.{{sfn|Crowl|2000|p=232}} Branagh set the film with late 19th-century costuming and furnishings, a production in many ways reminiscent of a Russian novel of the time;{{sfn|Starks|1999|p=272}} and [[Blenheim Palace]], built in the early 18th century, became Elsinore Castle in the external scenes. The film is structured as an [[Epic film|epic]] and makes frequent use of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s to highlight elements not made explicit in the play: Hamlet's sexual relationship with [[Kate Winslet]]'s Ophelia, for example, or his childhood affection for Yorick (played by [[Ken Dodd]]).{{sfn|Keyishian|2000|pp=78–9}}

In 2000, [[Michael Almereyda]]'s ''[[Hamlet (2000 film)|Hamlet]]'' set the story in contemporary [[Manhattan]], with [[Ethan Hawke]] playing Hamlet as a film student. Claudius (played by [[Kyle MacLachlan]]) became the CEO of &quot;Denmark Corporation&quot;, having taken over the company by killing his brother.{{sfn|Burnett|2003}}

The 2002 ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode &quot;[[Tales from the Public Domain]]&quot; features a retelling of the play.

There have also been several films that transposed the general storyline of ''Hamlet'' or elements thereof to other settings. For example, the 2014 [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Haider (film)|Haider]]'' is an adaptation set in [[Kashmir]].{{sfn|Gupta|2014}} There have also been many films which included performances of scenes from ''Hamlet'' as a [[Story within a story|play-within-a-film]].

===Stage pastiches===
There have been various &quot;derivative works&quot; of ''Hamlet'' which recast the story from the point of view of other characters, or transpose the story into a new setting or act as sequels or prequels to ''Hamlet''. This section is limited to those written for the stage.

The best-known is Tom Stoppard's 1966 play ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', which retells many of the events of the story from the point of view of the characters Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and gives them a backstory of their own. Several times since 1995, the [[American Shakespeare Center]] has mounted repertories that included both ''Hamlet'' and ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern'', with the same actors performing the same roles in each; in their 2001 and 2009 seasons the two plays were &quot;directed, designed, and rehearsed together to make the most out of the shared scenes and situations&quot;.{{sfn|Warren|n.d.}}

Gilbert]] wrote a short comic play titled ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (play)|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]'', in Hamlet's play is presented as a tragedy written by Claudius in his youth of which he is greatly embarrassed. Through the chaos triggered by Hamlet's staging of it, Guildenstern helps Rosencrantz vie with Hamlet to make Ophelia his bride.{{sfn|Gilbert|1892|pp=349–66}}

[[Lee Blessing]]'s ''[[Fortinbras (play)|Fortinbras]]'' is a comical sequel to ''Hamlet'' in which all the deceased characters come back as ghosts. The ''New York Times'' reviewed the play, saying it is &quot;scarcely more than an extended comedy sketch, lacking the portent and linguistic complexity of Tom Stoppard's ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead''. ''Fortinbras'' operates on a far less ambitious plane, but it is a ripping yarn and offers Keith Reddin a role in which he can commit comic mayhem&quot;.{{sfn|Gussow|1992}}

[[Caridad Svich]]'s ''12 Ophelias (a play with broken songs)'' includes elements of the story of ''Hamlet'' but focuses on Ophelia. In Svich's play, Ophelia is resurrected and rises from a pool of water, after her death in ''Hamlet''. The play is a series of scenes and songs, and was first staged at public swimming pool in Brooklyn.{{sfn|Schultz|2008}} 

[[David Davalos]]' ''Wittenberg'' is a &quot;tragical-comical-historical&quot; prequel to ''Hamlet'' that depicts the Danish prince as a student at Wittenberg University (now known as the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]]), where he is torn between the conflicting teachings of his mentors [[Faust|John Faustus]] and [[Martin Luther]]. The ''New York Times'' reviewed the play, saying, &quot;Mr. Davalos has molded a daft campus comedy out of this unlikely convergence,&quot;{{sfn|Grode|2011}} and ''[[Nytheatre.com]]'''s review said the playwright &quot;has imagined a fascinating alternate reality, and quite possibly, given the fictional Hamlet a back story that will inform the role for the future.&quot;{{sfn|Todoroff|2011}}

''Mad Boy Chronicle'' by Canadian playwright Michael O'Brien is a dark comedy loosely based on ''Hamlet'', set in Viking Denmark in 999 A.D.{{sfn|Brandes|2001}}

===Notes===
{{notelist|30em}}

===References===
{{refbegin}}
All references to ''Hamlet'', unless otherwise specified, are taken from the [[Arden Shakespeare]] Q2.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006a}} Under their referencing system, 3.1.55 means act 3, scene 1, line 55. References to the First Quarto and [[First Folio]] are marked ''Hamlet Q1'' and ''Hamlet F1'', respectively, and are taken from the Arden Shakespeare ''Hamlet: the texts of 1603 and 1623''.{{sfn|Thompson|Taylor|2006b}} Their referencing system for Q1 has no act breaks, so 7.115 means scene 7, line 115.

'''''Gods of Egypt''''' is a 2016 English-language [[fantasy film]] directed by [[Alex Proyas]] and portraying [[ancient Egyptian deities]]. It stars [[Gerard Butler]], [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]], [[Brenton Thwaites]], [[Chadwick Boseman]], [[Élodie Yung]], [[Courtney Eaton]], [[Rufus Sewell]] and [[Geoffrey Rush]]. The film portrays a mortal Egyptian hero who partners with the Egyptian god [[Horus]] to save the world from [[Set (mythology)|Set]] and rescue his love.&lt;ref name=&quot;story&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.godsofegypt.movie/story | title=Gods of Egypt &amp;#124; Official Movie Site &amp;#124; Story | work=godsofegypt.movie | publisher=[[Lionsgate]] | accessdate=February 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming took place in Australia under the American film production and distribution company [[Summit Entertainment]]. While the film's production budget was {{nowrap|$140 million,}} the parent company [[Lionsgate]]'s financial exposure was less than $10 million due to tax incentives and pre-sales. The Australian government provided a tax credit for 46% of the film's budget. When Lionsgate began promoting the film in November 2015, it [[#Racial and ethnic casting|received backlash]] for its predominantly [[Whitewashing in film|white cast playing Egyptian deities]]. In response, Lionsgate and director Proyas apologized for ethnically-inaccurate casting.

Lionsgate released ''Gods of Egypt'' in theaters globally, starting on {{nowrap|February 25}}, 2016, in 2D, [[RealD 3D]], and [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]], and in the United States, Canada, and 68 other markets on {{nowrap|February 26}}. The film was poorly reviewed by critics, who criticized its choice of cast, script, acting and special effects. It grossed a total of $150 million against a $140 million budget. It received five nominations at the [[37th Golden Raspberry Awards]].

==Plot==
{{plot|date=June 2017}}
In an alternate version of Egypt, the world is flat and the [[Egyptian gods]] live among humans, they differ from humans by their greater height, golden blood, and ability to transform into their divine forms.

A young thief named Bek and his love Zaya are attending the coronation of [[Horus]]. During the ceremony, [[Osiris]] is killed by his extremely jealous brother [[Set (deity)|Set]], who seizes the throne and declares a new regime where the dead will have to pay with riches to pass into the afterlife. Horus is stripped of his eyes, the source of his power, and almost killed. His love, [[Hathor]] pleads with Set in surrender to spare him and he is instead exiled.

A year later, Bek has been working as a slave building monuments while Zaya is now under the ownership of Set's chief architect Urshu. Believing that Horus is the only one who can defeat Set, she gives Bek the floor plans to his treasure vault and also manages to get a glimpse of the plans for his pyramid. Bek is able to steal back one of Horus' eyes from the treasure vault. However, Urshu finds out and kills Zaya as the couple flee. Bek takes her body to the blind Horus and makes a bargain: Horus agrees to bring Zaya back from the dead for his eye and Bek's knowledge about Set's pyramid.

The two fly to the [[Solar deity#Solar barge and sun chariot|divine vessel]] of Horus' grandfather [[Ra]]. Horus is unable to convince his grandfather to regrant him his power so he can defeat Set himself, as Ra is both neutral about their conflict and daily at war with the enormous shadow beast [[Apep|Apophis]] that threatens to devour the world. Ra does however allow Horus to obtain a vial of the divine waters that surround his vessel, which can extinguish the desert thirst and weaken Set gravely. Ra tells Horus that his weakness is the result of him not fulfilling his destiny, which Horus believes means avenging his parents' deaths.

Elsewhere, Set asks Hathor to take him to the underworld, but she refuses and manages to escape. After surviving an attack by Set's Egyptian [[Minotaur]]s led by [[Mnevis]] and an attack by some of Set's minions and their giant cobras, Hathor finds and saves Bek and Horus. Horus at first doesn't trust her as she is a mistress of Set, while she tries to convince him that Set is her enemy as well. When they tell her of their plan regarding Set's pyramid, she warns them of a guardian [[Sphinx#Egyptian sphinxes|sphinx]] who will kill anyone not wise enough to solve a riddle. The group then heads to the library of [[Thoth]], so they can recruit him to solve the riddle.

Arriving at Set's pyramid, they overcome its traps including the sphinx, to reach the source of Set's power. But before they can pour the divine water, Set traps them and reveals to Bek that Horus cannot bring Zaya back from the dead. Set destroys their flask and kills Thoth by taking his brain. Horus is able to save Hathor and Bek. Horus admits to caring more about his revenge than the mortals. Hathor sacrifices her own safety for Zaya's payment into the afterlife by giving Bek her bracelet and calls [[Anubis]] to take him to Zaya, letting herself be dragged to the underworld.

Having combined Thoth's brain, Osiris's heart, Horus's eye, and wings from [[Nephthys]] with himself, Set travels to Ra, questioning his favoritism for Osiris and denying him the throne and children. Ra claims that all of Set's prior mistreatments were tests preparing Set for his true role: the honor and burden of taking Ra's place as the defender of the world aboard his solar barge, fighting against the demon Apophis. Set is dismayed to hear his destiny and wants to destroy the afterlife so that he can be immortal. Ra tries to fight Set by blasting him with his spear, though Set survives. He stabs Ra to his surprise, takes his spear of power, and casts him off the boat freeing Apophis to consume both the mortal and underworld realms.

Bek finds Zaya, who refuses Hathor's gift as she doesn't want an afterlife without Bek, but then Apophis attacks and the [[Book of Gates|gate to the afterlife]] is closed. Bek returns to the mortal world, where Horus is amazed that Bek still wants to help take down Set. Bek tells him it was Zaya who told him to, as she still has faith in Horus.

Horus climbs up the outer wall of an obelisk Set is standing on and attempts to battle him, but is heavily outmatched. Whilst Bek fights Urshu who is thrown off to his death, Bek ascends on the inside and joins the battle, removing Horus's stolen eye from Set's armor, being wounded in the process. As Bek slides toward the edge of the obelisk, he throws the eye toward Horus, who must choose to catch it or save Bek instead. Horus reaches for Bek and apologizes for all he has put him through. As they plummet toward the ground, Horus finds that he now has the power to transform into his divine form and he catches Bek and flies him to safety. Horus realizes that it wasn't the recovery of his eye nor revenge that was his destiny, it was the protection of his people that he needed to fight for. Now, Horus has the strength for battling Set, and he gains the obelisk and kills him. After the battle and Set's death, he then finds Ra wounded and floating in space, and returns his spear to him, allowing Ra to once again repel Apophis and for Anubis to reopen the gates.

As Horus returns to Bek, a child holds out his other eye which she has found, while people cheer him. But Horus's joy turns to sadness as he arrives to find Bek dying from the wounds he sustained whilst fighting Set. Horus carries him to Osiris's tomb and lays him beside Zaya. Ra arrives and offers to bestow any power on him to repay Horus for his life and Egypt's survival. All Horus wants is bringing Bek and Zaya back to life. The other gods are also revived and have their attributes restored (except for Osiris and Isis, who died a full year before and have already passed into the Afterlife). Horus is crowned king by Thoth and declares the afterlife will be for those who do good in the world. Bek is made [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|chief advisor]], and he gives Horus back Hathor's bracelet letting him leave to rescue her from the underworld.

{{Quote box|width=25%|align=right|quote=... the world of ''Gods of Egypt'' never really existed. It is inspired by Egyptian mythology, but it makes no attempt at historical accuracy because that would be pointless — none of the events in the movie ever really happened. It is about as reality-based as ''Star Wars'' — which is not real at all ... Maybe one day if I get to make further chapters I will reveal the context of the when and where of the story. But one thing is for sure — it is not set in Ancient Egypt at all.|source=Director Alex Proyas, December 2015&lt;ref name=&quot;groves20151215&quot; /&gt;
}}
''Gods of Egypt'' is directed by [[Alex Proyas]] based on a screenplay by [[Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless]]. The film was produced under [[Summit Entertainment]]. Proyas was contracted by Summit in May 2012, to write the screenplay with Sazama and Sharpless, and to direct the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sneider | first=Jeff | url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/proyas-in-talks-for-summit-s-gods-of-egypt-1118054227/ | title=Proyas in talks for Summit's 'Gods of Egypt' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=May 17, 2012 | accessdate=November 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proyas said he sought to make a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|big-budget]] film with an original premise, to contrast franchise films. The director cited the following films as influences on ''Gods of Egypt'': ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' (1961), ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962), ''[[The Man Who Would Be King (film)|The Man Who Would Be King]]'' (1975), ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), and [[Sergio Leone]]'s Western films.&lt;ref name=&quot;groves20160203&quot; /&gt; [[Lionsgate]] anticipated for ''Gods of Egypt'' to be the first film in a new franchise after it finished releasing [[The Hunger Games (film series)|''The Hunger Games'' films]].&lt;ref name=&quot;faughnder&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Faughnder | first=Ryan | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-movie-projector-gods-of-egypt-20160224-story.html | title=A roughly $15-million debut is predicted for 'Gods of Egypt' -- a $140-million film | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=February 24, 2016 | accessdate=February 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
The film was shot in Australia. A crew of 200 began pre-production in [[Sydney]] in [[New South Wales]], and producers considered filming in [[Melbourne]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to take advantage of the state's tax incentive. [[Docklands Studios Melbourne]] was too booked to accommodate ''Gods of Egypt'', and producers were instead offered an airport facility for production.&lt;ref name=&quot;maddox&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Maddox | first=Gary | url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/interstate-battle-for-gods-of-egypt-movie-decided-20140224-33bgl.html | title=Interstate battle for Gods of Egypt movie decided | work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=February 24, 2014 | accessdate=November 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian states New South Wales and Victoria competed to be the location of the film's production, and Summit selected NSW in February 2014. The state's deputy premier, [[Andrew Stoner]], estimated that the production would add 400 jobs to the state and contribute {{nowrap|$75}} million to its economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;frater&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Frater | first=Patrick | url=https://variety.com/2014/film/asia/summits-gods-of-egypt-heads-for-australia-shoot-1201119763/ | title=Summit's 'Gods of Egypt' Heads for Australia Shoot | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=February 24, 2014 | accessdate=November 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The union Media Entertainment &amp; Arts Alliance filed an objection with Australia's [[Fair Work Commission]] stating that the film would adopt unfair work conditions.

Jon Feltheimer, the CEO of Summit's parent company [[Lionsgate]], said Lionsgate's financial exposure was under {{nowrap|$10 million}} due to tax incentives of filming in Australia, as well as foreign pre-sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McNary | first=Dave | url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/lionsgate-has-franchise-fever-looks-to-duplicate-hunger-games-success-1201198677/ | title=Lionsgate Has Franchise Fever, Looks to Duplicate 'Hunger Games' Success | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=May 30, 2014 | accessdate=November 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Busch | first=Anita | url=https://deadline.com/2016/02/lionsgate-2017-slate-star-wars-grabbed-50m-to-100m-from-mockingjay-2-1201697048/ | title=Lionsgate Plans 17 Films For 2017, Says 'Star Wars' Grabbed $50M-$100M From 'Mockingjay 2'; Stock Falls 27% | work=[[Deadline.com]] | date=February 5, 2016 | accessdate=February 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian government's tax credit to have the film produced in the country covered 46% of the {{nowrap|$140 million}} production budget, and most of the remaining budget was covered by the foreign pre-sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;cunningham&quot; /&gt;

In the film, the gods in humanoid form are {{convert|9|ft|m}} tall and in &quot;battle beast&quot; form are over {{convert|12|ft|m}} tall. Proyas used [[forced perspective]] and [[motion control photography]] to portray the difference in height between the actors portraying the gods and the humans. Proyas called the logistical challenge a &quot;reverse Hobbit&quot;, referring to ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' films, in which Hobbits are depicted as shorter than humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;groves20151215&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Groves | first=Don | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dongroves/2015/12/15/the-gods-of-egypt-alex-proyas-grapples-with-a-size-issue-in-fantasy-adventure/ | title='The Gods of Egypt': Alex Proyas Grapples With a Size Issue In Fantasy Adventure | work=[[Forbes]] | date=December 15, 2015 | accessdate=January 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Sphinx]], actor Kenneth Ransom portrayed the giant creature via [[motion capture]]. For the god Thoth, who can appear as many copies, actor Chadwick Boseman was filmed hundreds of times from different angles. For a scene with many copies of Thoth, other actors took a day to film the scene, where Boseman filmed the scene for three days.&lt;ref name=&quot;groves20160210&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Groves | first=Don | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dongroves/2016/02/10/gods-of-egypt-unleashes-its-own-golem-a-giant-sphinx-of-stone/ | title='Gods Of Egypt' Unleashes Its Own Golem, A Giant Sphinx Of Stone | work=[[Forbes]] | date=February 10, 2016 | accessdate=February 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Composer [[Marco Beltrami]], who scored Proyas's previous films ''[[Knowing (film)|Knowing]]'' (2009) and ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' (2004), returned to score ''Gods of Egypt''.&lt;ref name=&quot;groves20151215&quot; /&gt;

==Racial and ethnic casting==
{{See also|Whitewashing in film}}
White actors make up most of the principal cast of ''Gods of Egypt''. When [[Lionsgate]] began marketing the film, the [[Associated Press]] said the distributor received backlash for ethnically inaccurate casting. Lionsgate and director Alex Proyas both issued apologies. The AP said, &quot;While some praised the preemptive [[mea culpa]] ... others were more skeptical, concluding that it's simply meant to shut down any further backlash.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bahr&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Bahr |first=Lindsey |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c7a2e028d4c246808f9422f264f6e074/gods-egypt-renews-concern-about-inaccurate-film-casting |title='Gods of Egypt' renews concern about inaccurate film casting |work=ap.org |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=December 14, 2015 |accessdate=January 12, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dnaUNIpo?url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c7a2e028d4c246808f9422f264f6e074/gods-egypt-renews-concern-about-inaccurate-film-casting |archivedate=December 15, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The casting practice of white actors as Egyptian characters was first reported after filming started in March 2014, when ''Daily Life''{{'}}s Ruby Hamad highlighted the practice as &quot;Hollywood whitewashing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hamad | first=Ruby | url=http://www.dailylife.com.au/news-and-views/dl-opinion/all-lead-actors-in-the-gods-of-egypt-will-be-white-20140401-35vzp.html | title=All lead actors in The Gods of Egypt will be white | work=Daily Life | publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] | date=April 1, 2014 | accessdate=November 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lionsgate released a set of character posters in November 2015, and ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the casting received a backlash on [[Twitter]] over the predominantly white cast. Some suggested that the casting of black actor [[Chadwick Boseman]], who plays the god [[Thoth]], played into the [[Magical Negro]] stereotype. The previous year, the biblical epic ''[[Exodus: Gods and Kings]]'' by director [[Ridley Scott]] received similar backlash for having a white cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;lee&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Lee | first=Benjamin | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/13/gods-of-egypt-posters-anger-whitewashed-cast-twitter-exodus | title=Gods of Egypt posters spark anger with 'whitewashed' cast | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=November 13, 2015 | accessdate=November 13, 2015 }}

She said with the release of [[Aziz Ansari]]'s TV series ''[[Master of None]]'' in the previous week, &quot;Whitewashed casting and the offensiveness of brownface has pretty much dominated the pop culture conversation this week. Promotion for the movie is beginning just as we're wrapping a banner year for discussions of diversity and gender pay equity in the film industry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=McDonald | first=Soraya Nadia | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/11/12/gods-of-egypt-promo-posters-reveal-no-lessons-learned-from-exodus-fiasco/ | title='Gods of Egypt' promo posters reveal no lessons learned from ‘Exodus’ fiasco | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=November 12, 2015 | accessdate=November 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lionsgate followed its release of posters with a release of a theatrical trailer, Scott Mendelson at ''[[Forbes]]'' said, &quot;The implication remains that white actors, even generic white actors with zero box office draw, are preferable in terms of domestic and overseas box office than culturally-specific (minority) actors who actually look like the people they are supposed to be playing.&quot; He said almost none of the actors, aside from potentially Butler, qualified as box office draws.&lt;ref name=&quot;mendelson&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Mendelson | first=Scott | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2015/11/17/gods-of-egypt-gets-a-visually-spectacular-trailer/ | title='Gods Of Egypt,' With Gerald Butler And Chadwick Boseman, Gets A Visually Spectacular Trailer | work=[[Forbes]] | date=November 17, 2015 | accessdate=November 17, 2015 }}

In response to criticisms of its casting practice, director Alex Proyas and Lionsgate issued apologies in late November 2015 for not considering diversity; Lionsgate said it would strive to do better.

In the month leading up to release, director Proyas said his film was fantasy and not intended to be history. He cited &quot;creative license and artistic freedom of expression&quot; to cast the actors he found to fit the roles. He said &quot;white-washing&quot; was a justified concern but for his fantasy film, &quot;To exclude any one race in service of a hypothetical theory of historical accuracy... would have been biased.&quot; Proyas said that films &quot;need more people of color and a greater cultural diversity&quot; but that ''Gods of Egypt'' &quot;is not the best one to soap-box issues of diversity with&quot;. He argued that the lack of English-speaking Egyptian actors, production practicalities, the studio's requirement for box office draws, and Australia having guidelines limiting &quot;imported&quot; actors were all factors in casting for the film. He concluded, &quot;I attempted to show racial diversity, black, white, Asian, as far as I was allowed, as far as I could, given the limitations I was given. It is obviously clear that for things to change, for casting in movies to become more diverse many forces must align. Not just the creative. To those who are offended by the decisions which were made I have already apologised. I respect their opinion, but I hope the context of the decisions is a little clearer based on my statements here.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;groves20160203&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Groves | first=Don | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dongroves/2016/02/03/gods-of-egypt-silly-and-campy-or-an-unlikely-blockbuster/#3e3b28f349a4 | title='Gods Of Egypt'- Silly And Outdated, Or An Unlikely Blockbuster? | work=[[Forbes]] | date=February 3, 2016 | accessdate=February 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the film was critically panned, Proyas said, &quot;I guess I have the knack of rubbing reviewers the wrong way.

==Release==

===Marketing===
[[Lionsgate]] spent an estimated {{nowrap|$30 million}} on marketing the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;cunningham&quot; /&gt; It released a set of character posters in November 2015, for which it received backlash due to white actors playing Egyptian characters, as noted above.&lt;ref name=&quot;lee&quot; /&gt; Later in the month, it released a theatrical trailer.&lt;ref name=&quot;mendelson&quot; /&gt; Lionsgate aired a 60-second spot for ''Gods of Egypt'' during the [[pre-game show]] of the [[Super Bowl 50]] on February 7, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hipes | first=Patrick | url=https://deadline.com/2016/02/gods-of-egypt-super-bowl-ad-plan-lionsgate-1201697030/ | title='Gods Of Egypt' Getting 60-Second Spot In Super Bowl Pre-Game Show | work=[[Deadline.com]] | date=February 5, 2016 | accessdate=February 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though they released the trailer online a day earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Lincoln | first=Ross A. | url=https://deadline.com/2016/02/new-gods-of-egypt-trailer-alex-proyas-gerard-butler-1201697792/ | title=New 'Gods Of Egypt' Trailer: Lionsgate Unleashes Super Bowl Spot A Day Early | work=[[Deadline.com]] | date=February 6, 2016 | accessdate=February 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the week before the film's release, Lions released the [[tie-in]] [[mobile game]] ''Gods of Egypt: Secrets of the Lost Kingdom'' on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hannley | first=Steve | url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/02/17/gods-of-egypt-movie-tie-in-game-gets-a-surprise-release/193462/ | title=Gods Of Egypt Movie Tie-In Game Gets a Surprise Release | work=Hardcore Gamer | date=February 17, 2016 | accessdate=February 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office forecast===
''[[BoxOffice (magazine)|BoxOffice]]'' forecast two months in advance that ''Gods of Egypt'' would gross {{nowrap|$14.5 million}} on its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, and that it would gross {{nowrap|$34 million}} total on its theatrical run. The magazine said the film had &quot;a strong ensemble cast&quot; and that its director has &quot;had a noteworthy following&quot;. ''BoxOffice'' also said the premise could attract movie-goers who saw ''Clash of the Titans'', ''[[Wrath of the Titans]]'', and the ''[[Percy Jackson (film series)|Percy Jackson]]'' films. Admissions to 3D screenings would help boost ''Gods of Egypt''{{'}}s gross. The magazine said factors negatively affecting the film's gross were a &quot;lackluster reaction&quot; to its marketing and the backlash to its predominantly white cast causing negative buzz. It anticipated that the film's release would be front-loaded (focused on profiting mainly from opening weekend) due to the poor buzz, its categorization as a fantasy film, and with ''[[London Has Fallen]]'' opening the following weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Garris | first=Daniel | url=http://pro.boxoffice.com/featured_stories/2016-01-long-range-forecast-gods-of-egypt-triple-9 | title=Long Range Forecast: 'Gods Of Egypt' &amp; 'Triple 9' | work=[[BoxOffice (magazine)|BoxOffice]] | date=January 2, 2016 | accessdate=January 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A week before the film's release, ''[[TheWrap]]''{{'s}} Todd Cunningham reported an updated forecast of {{nowrap|$15 million}} for its opening weekend in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;cunningham&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Cunningham | first=Todd | url=http://www.thewrap.com/gods-of-egypt-on-track-for-15-million-opening-can-it-beat-the-odds-and-launch-a-franchise/ | title='Gods of Egypt' on Track for $15 Million Opening – Can It Beat the Odds and Launch a Franchise? | work=[[TheWrap]] | date=February 19, 2016 | accessdate=February 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Pamela McClintock said it was tracking to gross between {{nowrap|$12 million}} and {{nowrap|$15 million}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcclintock&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=McClintock | first=Pamela | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-deadpool-wont-have-869356 | title=Box-Office Preview: Big-Budget 'Gods of Egypt' Imperiled | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=February 24, 2016 | accessdate=February 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham said the expected gross was low for the film's triple-digit budget as well as additional marketing costs. He said the film could attract Alex Proyas's fan base but that it had suffered &quot;some negativity out there&quot; due to the predominantly white casting as well as the film being perceived to have an &quot;old-fashioned&quot; feel. Exhibitor Relations senior media analyst Jeff Bock said the film &quot;feels late&quot; years after the release of ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' (2007) and ''[[Immortals (2011 film)|Immortals]]'' (2011), and an earlier production and release would have been more advantageous. Cunningham said with Lionsgate's financial exposure only being {{nowrap|$10 million}} and the expected opening gross, the film could gross between {{nowrap|$40 million}} and {{nowrap|$50 million}} for its theatrical run in the United States and Canada and ultimately avoid a loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;cunningham&quot; /&gt; ''The Hollywood Reporter''{{'}}s McClintock said &quot;ancient epics&quot; in recent years had not performed well at the box office, citing the 2014 films ''[[Hercules (2014 film)|Hercules]]'', ''[[The Legend of Hercules]]'', and ''[[Pompeii (2014 film)|Pompeii]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcclintock&quot; /&gt;

Ryan Faughnder of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said in the week before the film's release that the expected opening weekend gross meant that Lionsgate's plans to make ''Gods of Egypt'' the first film in a new franchise were unlikely. Faughnder said the film would need to perform strongly in territories outside the United States and Canada for a sequel to be developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;faughnder&quot; /&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Brent Lang reported that analysts said the film would need to open to {{nowrap|$30 million}} or more in the United States to justify a sequel.&lt;ref name=&quot;lang&quot; /&gt;

===Theatrical run===
''Gods of Egypt'' grossed $31.2 million in the USA &amp; Canada, and $119.6 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $150.7 million against a budget of $140 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOM&quot;/&gt;

[[Alonso Duralde]] of [[TheWrap]] wrote, &quot;A mishmash of unconvincing visual effects and clumsy writing—not to mention another depiction of ancient Egypt in which the lead roles are almost all played by white folks—''Gods of Egypt'' might have merited a so-bad-it's-good [[schadenfreude]] fanbase had it maintained the unintentional laughs of its first 10 minutes.

'''''Aayirathil Oruvan''''' ({{lang-en|One Man in a Thousand}}) is a 2010 Indian [[Tamil language|Tamil-language]] [[action film|action]] [[adventure film]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/aayirathil-oruvan-2009 AAYIRATHIL ORUVAN (12A)  - British Board of Film Classification]&lt;/ref&gt; written and directed by [[Selvaraghavan]].

Parthiepan|Parthiepan]] playing a pivotal role.

The film begins with an episode in 1279&amp;nbsp;AD, when the successor of the last great [[Chola dynasty|Chola Emperor]], pending invasion, sends his people to a mystery location, to survive the threat. The story resumes with an archaeologist, a [[coolie]] and a member of the army going in search of the archaeologist's father to the ruined city that was the place the exiled Chola Prince retreated to. An expedition is promptly arranged, and on the course they stumble on the lost Chola civilization and its king and find unexplained links between them and the culture. The shocking events and the problems that arise forms the crux of the story.

''Aayirathil Oruvan'' languished in [[development hell]] due to slow progress of the shoot and the extensive pre- and post-production works, evading release dates ranging one year.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlyint&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Moviebuzz|year=2007|title=Selva on Aayirathil Oruvan |publisher=[[Sify]]|accessdate=15 December 2007|url=http://sify.com/movies/tamil/fullstory.php?id=14576230| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071216215313/http://sify.com/movies/tamil/fullstory.php?id=14576230| archivedate= 16 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shooting began in July 2007, and took place in various locations with 2,000 extras in areas including [[Chalakudy]], [[Kerala]] and [[Jaisalmer]], [[Rajasthan]] amongst other regions throughout India.&lt;ref name=&quot;shoothindu&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Rangarajan, Malathi|title=All eyes on Aayirathil Oruvan|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=14 January 2010|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2010/01/14/stories/2010011450791000.htm|location=Chennai, India|date=14 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100123161939/http://www.hindu.com/mp/2010/01/14/stories/2010011450791000.htm| archivedate= 23 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uncut, the film runs for 181 minutes, but the theatrical release was heavily cut at 153 minutes.

Upon release, the film received Positive reviews whilst proceeding to become a successful venture commercially.

The film was dubbed into [[Hindi]] as ''Kaashmora 2'', named after the [[Kaashmora|2016 Karthi-starrer of the same name]], by Goldmines Telefilms Pvt Ltd and released in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?list=PLvdrEOxqEIXwQinQ__HeH1sQla9C4endt&amp;v=O4FGsaag8hE|title=Kaashmora (Aayirathil Oruvan) 2017 Official Motion Poster|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1279 A.D., the downfall of the [[Chola dynasty]] seems imminent as the [[Pandya]]s drive the Chola people out of their kingdom in [[South India|southern India]]. To escape them and save the life of his successor the Chola emperor sends his son along with the Chola people to a secret territory. The refugees take along an idol sacred to the Pandyas, angering them. To capture the escaped Cholas and the stolen idol, the Pandyas extend their invasion to unexplored territories but cannot find them.

Centuries later, in 2009, Indian archaeologists continue searching for the existence of the lost Chola group based on clues left by the ancient Pandyan warriors. All archaeologists who attempted to search for the secret land have disappeared. Archaeologist Chandramouli is the most recent person to have gone missing suddenly.

The Indian government organizes a search expedition led by officer Anitha to find Chandramouli and the Chola empire; she is assisted by the Indian army led by Ravisekharan. They recruit archaeologist Lavanya, the estranged daughter of Chandramouli, because her insight is essential for the success of the expedition. She hands over crucial documents on the Chola dynasty, prepared by her father, with instructions on the route to reach the destination.

Along with the army, Anitha employs a group of [[Porter (carrier)|porters]] headed by Muthu, to transport the baggage during the journey. The crew embark on their voyage leading them to an island, Min-gua, near Vietnam. The island borders 3 countries: [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Malaysia]]. They face seven traps set by the Cholas: sea creatures, cannibals, warriors, snakes, hunger, quicksand and a village. Many porters and army men are killed by these traps.

Muthu, Anitha and Lavanya get separated from the others. They reach the ruins of a village where they are subjected to black magic and nearly go mad before reaching the secret hideout of the Chola. The three find an ethnic isolated primitive Tamil group, ruled by a Chola king. The king and his people are in hiding, awaiting the arrival of the fabled messenger who will bring glory and prosperity back to their land and lead them back to [[Thanjavur]], their motherland. The king and the priest consult the gods for omens and order Muthu, Anitha and Lavanya to be burnt alive as sacrifices.

Anitha tells the king that she is the messenger sent from the homeland. Muthu and Lavanya are enslaved while Anitha is given a chance to prove herself. She tries to seduce and convince the Chola king to march towards the homeland in two days so he can be crowned properly as a king. He suspects her bona fides since none of her actions match those described by the king's ancestors. The ancestors wrote that the messenger will be preceded by hail and following his ill-treatment will eventually help the tribe.

Meanwhile, Anitha drugs the priest and poisons the water sources. She catches a glimpse of the Pandyas' sacred idol and leaves, finally exposing her identity as a descendant of the [[Pandya Dynasty]]. The central minister, who sponsors the expedition, is also shown to be a Pandyan. The Chola king is shattered for having believed in Anitha. Ravishekaran who has escaped the traps and is the sole survivor gets backup and a larger army after getting an information from a hypnotized follower of Anitha from the Chola kingdom. The king discovers that Muthu is the true messenger who would save the Cholas from the clutches of Anitha and the army. The priest gives all of his magical powers, like invisibility and invulnerability to Muthu and dies.

The Cholas fight bravely, but eventually lose to technology and are taken prisoners. Their women are molested and raped by the army. The king is killed and the men drown in the seas with the king's body. Muthu is able to escape and save the Chola Prince.

==Cast==
* [[Karthi Sivakumar]] as Muthu, a chief [[coolie]] working at [[Chennai Port]], leading a very low class life alongside his fellow workers. Muthu, a die-hard fan of actor [[M. G. Ramachandran]], is taken on the journey and is one of the final trio who are taken into the [[Chola dynasty|Chola kingdom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;indiMGR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|title=Karthi as MGR fan|publisher=Indiaglitz.com|accessdate=17 December 2007|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/35341.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071218072949/http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/35341.html| archivedate= 18 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rediffreview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Srinivasan, Pavithra|year=2010|title=Aayirathil Oruvan is not for the faint hearted|publisher=[[Rediff]]|accessdate=14 January 2010|url=http://movies.rediff.com/report/2010/jan/14/south-tamil-movie-review-aayirathil-oruvan.htm| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100116214613/http://movies.rediff.com/report/2010/jan/14/south-tamil-movie-review-aayirathil-oruvan.htm| archivedate= 16 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Reemma Sen]] as Anitha Pandiyan, an intelligence officer who gathers a team to investigate the disappearance of Chandramouli. Anitha is strong-minded, ruthless and determined. However she nurtures a soft feeling for Muthu during the course of the journey. The film became Reemma Sen's first attempt at parallel cinema following a series of roles in commercial projects, and her portrayal was highly appreciated by film critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;toireview&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Devi Rani, Bhama |title=Aayirathil Oruvan |publisher=[[Times of India]] |accessdate=15 January 2010 |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/regional/tamil/movie-reviews/Aayirathil-Oruvan/movie-review/5452515.cms |date=16 January 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025231335/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/regional/tamil/movie-reviews/Aayirathil-Oruvan/movie-review/5452515.cms |archivedate=25 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Andrea Jeremiah]] as Lavanya Chandramouli, the estranged daughter of Chandramouli, who also embarks on the journey to find her father. An archaeologist by profession, Lavanya becomes the quiet tactical leader of the journey through her knowledge of the culture and the history of the Chola dynasty. She also becomes a love interest for Muthu. Andrea Jeremiah, like Karthi, appears in her second major role for the film, also singing parts of two songs which appear in the soundtrack. During the making of the film news websites linked Andrea with the director, [[Selvaraghavan]], albeit to the pair's displeasure.&lt;ref name=&quot;selvandra&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2009 |title=Selvaraghavan on his relationship with Andrea |publisher=Behindwoods |accessdate=17 December 2009 |url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/dec-09-03/selvaraghavan-aayirathil-oruvan-andrea-17-12-09.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222054816/http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/dec-09-03/selvaraghavan-aayirathil-oruvan-andrea-17-12-09.html |archivedate=22 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[R. Parthiepan]] as Chola King, successor and last of the [[Chola dynasty]] after escaping an attack from the Pandyas. The city that the Cholas lived in perished, resulting in the city becoming haunted with Parthiepan, the head of the people. The images for the Chola King, not dated or named in the film, were kept under wraps prior to the movie's release. Parthiepan signed for the role after much speculation that [[Dhanush]] would be selected,&lt;ref name=&quot;anewt&quot;/&gt; and his performance won plaudits from critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;toireview&quot;/&gt;
* [[Pratap K. Pothen]] as Chandramouli, an archaeologist who went missing during a search for the Chola kingdom, prompting a manhunt. Chandramouli earlier walked out on his daughter, Lavanya, and is later found trapped in the Chola kingdom.
* [[Azhagam Perumal]] as Ravisekharan, who leads the army brigade in the search for Chandramouli. Known for his exploitative and violent ways, Ravisekharan develops a mutual foe in Muthu and his fellow workers.

==Production==

===Development===
After the reception to his 2006 gangster film, ''[[Pudhupettai]]'', [[Selvaraghavan]] took a sabbatical to plan future projects and set up a production company, ''White Elephants'', whose first project ''[[Idhu Maalai Nerathu Mayakkam]]'' started in November 2006. The film was co-produced by new producer R. Ravindran, and the first schedule began with Karthi, whose first film, ''[[Paruthiveeran]]'', was awaiting release, and [[Sandhya (actress)|Sandhya]].&lt;ref name=&quot;imnm&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Pillai, Sridhar |year=2006 |title=In a lead role |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |accessdate=18 October 2006 |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2006/10/28/stories/2006102801060300.htm |location=Chennai, India |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906133221/http://www.hindu.com/mp/2006/10/28/stories/2006102801060300.htm |archivedate= 6 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was stalled in early 2007 due to cinematographer [[Arvind Krishna]]'s decision to leave ''White Elephants'' and the project was eventually shelved.&lt;ref name=&quot;aksplit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|title=Arvind Krishna and Selvaraghavan part ways|publisher=Cinesouth.com|accessdate=31 August 2007|url=http://www.cinesouth.com/masala/hotnews/new/31082007-2.shtml| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070902150833/http://www.cinesouth.com/masala/hotnews/new/31082007-2.shtml| archivedate= 2 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, Selvaraghavan announced a new film with a new team of [[Karthi Sivakumar|Karthi]] and [[Reemma Sen]] in the cast, with Ramji replacing regular Arvind Krishna as the cinematographer.&lt;ref name=&quot;anewt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|title=Karthi is Ayirathil Oruvan|publisher=Indiaglitz.com|accessdate=31 August 2007|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/32395.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070827011844/http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/32395.html| archivedate= 27 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erum Ali]], wife of actor [[Abbas (actor)|Abbas]], became the team's head costume designer,&lt;ref name=&quot;imnmerum&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Reddy, Krithika |year=2007 |title=It takes two pairs to tango |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |accessdate=31 July 2006 |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2008/07/31/stories/2008073151070300.htm |location=Chennai, India |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823064035/http://www.hindu.com/mp/2008/07/31/stories/2008073151070300.htm |archivedate=23 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst, Selvaraghavan's sister-in-law and [[Rajinikanth]]'s daughter, [[Aishwarya Dhanush]], was signed on as an associate director. The film was named after a popular [[M. G. Ramachandran]] film, ''[[Aayirathil Oruvan (1965 film)|Aayirathil Oruvan]]''. The producer was announced to be R.

Nearly six months after filming began, Yuvan Shankar Raja left the project, because he could not spend as much time on this film as Selvaraghavan wanted. Subsequently, the role of the music director was handed to [[G. V.

The film was launched in 2007 with Selvaraghavan's regular music director, [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]], following five successive successful albums together. However, Yuvan Shankar Raja was ousted from the project in March 2008 due to 'differences of opinion'.&lt;ref name=&quot;split&quot; /&gt; Subsequently, [[G. V.

'''''Ella Enchanted''''' is a 2004 [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[romantic comedy film]] directed by [[Tommy O'Haver]] and written by [[Karen McCullah Lutz]] and [[Kirsten Smith (writer)|Kirsten Smith]] loosely based on [[Gail Carson Levine]]'s 1997 [[Ella Enchanted|novel of the same name]]. Starring [[Anne Hathaway]] and [[Hugh Dancy]], the film plays with the usual [[fairy tale]] genre.

The film is a [[International co-production|co-production]] between companies in [[Cinema of the United States|the United States]], [[Cinema of Ireland|Ireland]], and [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]].

==Plot==
Within the kingdom of Emir, in the town of Frell, a baby girl named Ella is born to Sir Peter and his wife Lady Eleanor. She is given the &quot;gift of obedience&quot; by a misguided and obnoxious fairy called Lucinda. This turns out to be more of a [[curse]], as it forces Ella to do anything she is told to do, even if the command is against her wishes. Ella's mother, on her deathbed, warns her daughter not to tell anyone about the curse she is under for fear that someone might use it to exploit Ella. After her mother's death, only Mandy, the household fairy, knows the secret.

Several years later, Ella's father remarries to a wealthy socialite, Dame Olga, who dislikes Ella. Her spoiled daughters Hattie and Olive notice Ella's obedience and start to humiliate her. Ella stumbles upon Prince Charmont , the handsome heir who will soon take the throne, as he's being pursued by his fan club of besotted young women. He invites Ella to the Coronation Ball, but Olga intercepts the invitation. Hattie and Olive, fan club members themselves, are overcome with jealousy. They force Ella to insult and cut ties with her best friend Areida.

Ella cannot bear her situation a moment longer, and resolves to find Lucinda, as she is the only one who can reverse the spell. Mandy helps by lending Ella her boyfriend Benny, whom she accidentally transformed into a talking magical book that can show people in their current surroundings. During her journey, Ella encounters an elf named Slannen, who wants to be a lawyer instead of an entertainer as the laws now require. They are both captured by a group of ogres, who want to eat them. Prince Charmont rescues them and accompanies them to a wedding in the land of giants, where Ella hopes to find Lucinda. En route, Ella opens Char's eyes to the cruelty of the laws [[Anthropocentrism#In fiction|oppressing elves and giants]] established by the [[Regent|acting ruler]], Char's uncle Sir Edgar. Char invites Ella to visit the palace's Hall of Records and find Lucinda faster. But Edgar's talking snake, Heston, is spying on them.

At the palace, Heston tells Edgar about Ella's obedience, which Hattie confirms when Edgar offers her Char's hand in marriage. Knowing that Char intends to marry Ella, Edgar orders her to kill him when he proposes, and keep the plan a secret. Edgar also reveals that he murdered Char's father. To save Char, Ella writes him a letter, saying she is leaving permanently and cannot explain why, which breaks his heart. She then asks Slannen to tie her to a tree and get the giants to help. Lucinda then appears before Ella, who asks her to undo the &quot;gift&quot; of obedience. Lucinda is offended that Ella doesn't like her gift and simply tells Ella to remove it herself. She unties Ella, gives her a fancy dress, and tells her to attend the ball, where Char almost immediately takes her to the Hall of Mirrors and asks her to marry him.

Ella is about to stab him with the dagger Edgar provided, when she realizes Lucinda has provided the answer: looking into a mirror, she says, &quot;You will no longer be obedient!&quot; She drops the dagger and Char sees it. But Edgar is spying on them, and before Ella can explain, he orders the guards to lock her up, to be executed the following day.

Meanwhile, Benny informs Slannen, the giants, and the ogres that Ella is in trouble, so they all sneak into the castle to rescue her. They find out that Edgar is poisoning the crown Char will receive during the ceremony. Ella and her allies burst in just in time to stop him putting it on. Edgar and Heston call for the knights and Red Guards, and a battle ensues. Ella explains everything while fighting alongside Char, while Mandy manages to transform Benny back into a human. When Edgar's forces lose, Heston tries to [[Snakebite|bite]] Char, but is stopped by Ella, then trampled by Char's fan club. Caught trying to kill the prince, Edgar admits to the crowd that he killed the King, but says only he deserves the crown. Then, carried away by his own rhetoric, Edgar crowns himself and accidentally poisons himself.

Char and Ella kiss; her stepsisters arrive and order her to stop, but she happily refuses. Char once again asks Ella to marry him, and she agrees: &quot;Now ''that'' I'll do.&quot; The movie ends with their wedding and a musical number. During all this, it's shown that Slannen is in a relationship with a giant named Brumhilda, Ella has rekindled her friendship with Areida, and Edgar has survived (albeit cognitively impaired by the poison). The Narrator announces two final words: The End.

==Production==
Hathaway, who first read the book when she was 16, says that there was originally a version of the script that was much closer to the book but that it didn't work as a film; she added that she prefers the way the movie actually turned out because it &quot;makes fun of itself for being a fairy tale.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutAnne&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.about.com/cs/ellaenchanted/a/elenah033104.htm |title=Anne Hathaway on &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; and Her Princess Roles | accessdate=2008-11-11 |last=Murray |first=Rebecca |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=About.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Levine states that the film is &quot;so different from the book that it's hard to compare them,&quot; noting the addition of new characters such as Sir Edgar and Heston, and suggested &quot;regarding the movie as a separate creative act&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kidsreads.com/authors/au-levine-gail-carson.asp |title=Gail Carson Levine |accessdate=2008-11-11 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=Kidsreads.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hathaway did her own singing in the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutAnne&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.about.com/cs/ellaenchanted/a/elenhd033104.htm |title=Hugh Dancy Captures Hearts in &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; |accessdate=2008-11-11 |last=Murray |first=Rebecca |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=About.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jimi Mistry]], a British actor of Indian descent, said that he enjoyed playing a talking book in the film because it offered him the opportunity to do something different from his other roles. &quot;You can't get less Indian than a talking book, and an American talking book, so it was great,&quot; he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue301/news.html |title=Science Fiction News of the Week |accessdate=2008-12-02 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=Science Fiction Weekly |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720040806/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue301/news.html |archivedate=July 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fratricide Punished''''', or ''The Tragedy of Fratricide Punished: or Prince Hamlet of Denmark'', is the English name of a German-language [[Play (theatre)|play]] of anonymous origins and disputed age. Due to similarities of plot and [[Dramatis personæ|dramatis personae]], it is considered to be a German variant of the English play ''[[Hamlet]]'', though possibly not [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare’s]] ''Hamlet'', and is a problematic figure in discussions of [[Hamlet Q1]] and the so-called [[Ur-Hamlet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hamlets: Cues, Qs, and remembered texts.|last=Menzer|first=Paul|publisher=University of Delaware Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=130–132|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such discussions have helped to raise interest in the text, which primarily lived in obscurity before the discovery of Q1 in 1823.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; ''Fratricide Punished'' was first published in German from a written manuscript in 1781 and translated to English by Georgina Archer in 1865.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=&quot;If I could see the Puppets Dallying&quot;: Der Bestrafte Brudermord and Hamlet’s Encounters with Puppets.|journal=Shakespeare Bulletin|volume=31|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198708735.001.0001/acref-9780198708735-e-304|title=Der Bestrafte Brudermord|last=Dobson|first=Michael|date=2015|website=Oxford Reference|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hamlet after Q1: an uncanny history of the Shakespearean text|last=Lesser|first=Zachary|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2015|isbn=9780812223569|location=Philadelphia|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shakespeare in Germany in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries|last=Cohn|first=Albert|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1865|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the play is readily available online both in English and in German, the manuscript has been lost since its initial publication, and all subsequent editions of the text are, as such, at a remove from the original.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; ''Fratricide Punished'' is often referred to by its &lt;nowiki/&gt;German title ''Der Bestrafte Brudermord,'' or ''Tragoedia der bestrafte Bruder-mord oder: Prinz Hamlet aus Dännemark.''

=== Plot ===
''Fratricide Punished'' is a play of five acts, each containing a minimum of six and as many as eleven scenes. While this may suggest a longer play, some scenes are quite scant. For instance, act three, scene seven contains just two sentences of dialogue from a single character. The play as published by ''[[Internet Shakespeare Editions]]'' runs approximately 545 lines. It contains minimal stage direction, restricting itself to character entrances, musical descriptions, and descriptors of physical action.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/doc/Brudermord_M/complete/|title=Der Bestrafte Brudermord|last=|first=|date=|website=Internet Shakespeare Editions|publisher=University of Victoria|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot runs largely along the lines of the familiar Shakespearean ''Hamlet,'' but it differs on occasion both in its events and the order of those events, and is notable for its elements of comedic farce, which have been emphasized in various productions.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

The play begins with an [[Induction (play)|induction]], wherein Night, personified as a wicked, [[trickster]]-like figure, calls forth three &quot;furies&quot;, Alecto, Mägera, and Thisiphone, to assist her. She informs them that the new King of the land yearns for his sister-in-law and has murdered his brother—the previous king—so that he might have her. Night wishes to cloud both their judgements to aid in their incestuous relationship but also to sow discord and jealousy into their marriage. She also intends to raise up a desire for revenge in those loyal to the slain king. Alecto, Mägera, and Thisiphone agree to assist her. The play ends with an admonishment to those who would seek power through foul play to reconsider, as they will likely be repaid by similar means.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

The remainder of ''Fratricide Punished'' seems at once familiar to readers of ''Hamlet'', yet at times strange.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt; There are some important differences in the naming of characters. Perhaps the most noteworthy of these is Corambus, a name familiar in Q1 ''Hamlet'' but changed to Polonius in Q2 and the folio editions of Shakespeare's text. Corambus' son, Leonhard, is similarly named Laertes in those texts. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are noticeably absent, their roles replaced in part by unnamed Ruffians. The text also creates the character of Phantasmo to undertake a variety of roles, often comically.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt;

Other notable differences include the lack of Hamlet's &quot;to be or not to be&quot; soliloquy, among others, and Ophelia's decision to commit suicide by jumping down a hill. One of the more &quot;slapstick&quot; differences comes when the Prince has been sent to England, accompanied by his would-be assassins. He foils their attempt on his life by having them stand on either side of him. At the moment the assassins shoot, Hamlet falls to the ground with the result that they shoot one another instead of him.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The First Quarto of Hamlet|last=Irace|first=Kathleen|publisher=Cambridge UP|year=1999|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=20|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarities and differences between ''Fratricide Punished'', Q1 ''Hamlet'', and the second quarto and folio editions of ''Hamlet'' are a powerful point of discussion in academic discussions.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot; /&gt;

== History ==
Surprisingly little is known about the history of ''Fratricide Punished'' prior to its publication, and there is little academic consensus about its early origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Bad Quarto of Hamlet: A Critical Study|last=Duthie|first=George|publisher=Folcroft Press|year=1941|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German editor H.A.O. Reichard, who first published excerpts from the manuscript in his ''Theater-Kalender auf das Jahr 1779'' and went on to publish the work in its entirety in 1781 in his journal ''Olla Potrida,'' confirms only that the original bore the text &quot;Pretz, den 27. Oktober 1710&quot; (Pretz, October 27, 1710).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New Variorum Edition of Shakespeare|last=Shakespeare|first=William|publisher=J.B. Lippincott &amp; Co|year=1877|isbn=|editor-last=Furness|editor-first=Horace|location=Philadelphia|pages=114–142|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Nino Amico, referencing work by University of Catania professor Ingrid Hiller, claimed that the manuscript of ''Fratricide Punished'' was of a small format and some thirteen pages. Hiller's research, however, appears not to have been published and others have been unable to corroborate this elsewhere, such that even these scant details remain unconfirmable.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barasch|first=Francis|year=2004|title=Shakespeare and the Puppet Sphere|url=|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume=34|issue=2|pages=157–175|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1981|title=Shakespeare coi Pupi|journal=Quaderni di Teatro|volume=13|pages=96–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the date of October 27, 1710 clearly places the manuscript in time, if not necessarily the time it was written, the location of Pretz remains disputed. It is known from the original publication by Reichard that he obtained the manuscript of ''Fratricide Punished'' from [[Konrad Ekhof]], a theater manager and historian, who had recently died.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Ekhof's father-in-law had started a theater company in the town of [[Preetz]], a location in [[Plön]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], Germany, in 1710. This has led Oxford professor Tiffany Stern to assert that the &quot;Pretz&quot; annotation on the manuscript most likely refers to Preetz, intuiting that Ekhof must have received the text from his father-in-law.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Amico, however, places the text at [[Preetz Priory|Kloster Preetz]], a nunnery.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gersdorff|first=Wolfgang|year=1912|title=Vom Urspring des Deutschen 'Hamlet.'|url=|journal=Jahrbuch der Deutschen Shakespeare-Gesellschaft|volume=|pages=48|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others have argued that &quot;Pretz&quot; refers to either the towns of [[Graz|Graz, Austria]] or [[Pretzsch, Burgenlandkreis|Pretzsch]], Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Whatever answers the manuscript might have provided to these questions were lost when the manuscript itself was lost, at least as early as 1888.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Die Schauspiele der Englischen Komödianten|last=Creizenach|first=Wilhelm|publisher=|year=1889|isbn=|location=Berlin and Stuttgart|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the date of its writing, many scholars believe ''Fratricide Punished'' to be a manuscript developed over years of English performances in Germany beginning as early as 1586.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot; /&gt; Kareen Klein, building off a sizable scholarly tradition, traces the lineage from the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, where troupes of English comedians, forced abroad by closed theaters at home, began touring continental Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Kareen|year=2008|title=Paris, Romio and Julieta: Seventeenth-Century German Schakespeare|url=|journal=Shakespeare and His Collaborators over the Centuries|volume=|pages=85–105|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; They brought with them an expanded understanding of acting that included such fields as pantomime, dance, and clowning. Such physical skills were uncommon for continental actors of the time and would be necessary for performers looking to convey the meaning of their English-language scripts to audiences who spoke only German. That language barrier would, in time, cause the scripts of staples such as ''Romeo and Juliet'' and ''Titus Andronicus'', and perhaps ''Hamlet'', to be modified into simpler, more physical forms. Over time, as English troupes came to augment their numbers with German actors, their scripts would be translated into German editions.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;

=== Translation into English ===
Reflecting the importance of Q1 Hamlet on the perceived relevance of ''Fratricide Punished,'' the text was first translated into English by Georgina Archer, not for the sake of the play itself but rather for Albert Cohn's 1865 book ''Shakespeare in Germany.'' R.G. Latham provided another translation in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Two Dissertations on the Hamlet of Saxo Grammaticus and of Shakespear|last=Latham|first=R.G.|publisher=Williams and Norgate|year=1872|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming that Archer's translation attempted to too heavily mimic the style of Shakespeare, and citing minor differences with Latham, Furness supplied a new translation in his 1877 ''Variorum'' collection. More recently, Christine Schmidle produced a translation for her 2010 theatrical production of the play, an experience that led her to believe that much of the comical effect of the work was a result of language barriers and adaptation experienced and undertaken by English actors performing in German-speaking lands.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidle|first=Christine|year=2013|title=Bilingual Hamlet: Der Bestrafte Brudermord in the 21st Century|url=|journal=Shakespeare Bulletin|volume=31|pages=191–212|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship to Hamlet ===
{{further|Ur-Hamlet|Hamlet Q1|Hamlet}}

While scholars generally agree that ''Fratricide Punished'' is a [[memorial reconstruction]] descended from some form of ''Hamlet'', it remains uncertain from which ''Hamlet'' it comes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot; /&gt; The differences and similarities between ''Fratricide Punished'' and the three major forms of ''Hamlet'' were examined line-by-line by George Duthie in his 1941 criticism of the so-called &quot;bad quarto&quot; of Q1, and the ''Variorum'' of Furness published the texts side-by-side as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot; /&gt; Their analyses found a play that contained elements both of Q1 ''Hamlet'', published in 1603 but unknown until 1823, and the more familiar versions of the second quarto (1604) and folio (1623), as well as elements uniquely its own.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot; /&gt; This is a remarkably problematic finding for Shakespeare scholars, complicating an area already made difficult by the discovery of Q1.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Indeed, the majority of what has been written about ''Fratricide Punished'' exists strictly to better understand its relation to Q1 ''Hamlet'', such that it becomes troublesome to discuss one without the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

Yet, as it contains elements of all three versions, it seems clear that ''Fratricide Punished'' must have been reconstructed by an actor with knowledge of more than one version of ''Hamlet''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot; /&gt; Kathleen Irace, in presenting this, argues that the use of the name Corambus instead of Polonius firmly ties ''Fratricide Punished'' to Q1, as does the &quot;increased villainy&quot; of the King, who alone is responsible for devising the poisoning plot.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt; Yet, some elements exclusive to Q2 and F1 are found in the text as well. Irace points out that the first portion of the King's speech in Act I, Scene II is missing from Q1 ''Hamlet'' but oddly present in ''Fratricide Punished.''&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt; Meanwhile, elements exclusive to the text or shared only with Q1 would seem to some scholars to link ''Fratricide Punished'' to the ''Ur-Hamlet,'' a kind of primordial source text which some scholars have suggested was used by Shakespeare in creating his ''Hamlet''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; The existence of the ''Ur-Hamlet'' is debated in itself. Lastly, Duthie argues that the long gap between the assumed time of the text's creation and its discovery is wholly unaccounted for, leaving room for any number of changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot; /&gt;

Zachary Lesser, discussing the impact of Q1 ''Hamlet'' on the popular reception of Q2 and F1, demonstrates the way that both Q1 and ''Fratricide Punished'' have been used to support arguments from multiple camps across decades of time, a testament to the ongoing significance of the work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

== Production History ==
Though it may have been born from production, few productions of ''Fratricide Punished'' have been undertaken since its discovery. In 1924, [[William Poel]], a British actor and theater manager who had staged a production of Q1 Hamlet in 1881, mounted a production of the play in [[Oxford|Oxford, England]] at the [[Oxford Music Hall|New Oxford Theatre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shakespeare on the German Stage|last=Williams|first=Simon|publisher=Cambridge UP|year=2004|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.lib.ku.edu/spencer/tag/theater/|title=Kenneth Spencer Research Library|last=|first=|date=6 June 2014|website=The University of Kansas|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Prompt book|promptbook]], later published, contends that the audience met the characters with a derision and laughter far removed from the typical experience of ''Hamlet'' audiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=William Poel's Promptbook of Fratricide Punished|last=Poel|first=William|publisher=London Society for Theater Research|year=1956|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Falocco argues that, by choosing to perform both Q1 and ''Fratricide Punished,'' Poel was demonstrating a willingness to disregard the importance of Shakespeare's authorship in the text, in accordance with earlier understandings of authorship, a constant facet of ''Hamlet'' discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reimagining Shakespeare's Playhouse|last=Falocco|first=Joe|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not to say that ''Fratricide Punished'' is without influence on theatrical productions. Both Q1 Hamlet and ''Fratricide Punished'' place their scenes in a different order than do the Q2 and folio versions of ''Hamlet'', and this may have inspired stage directors to reorder their own productions of ''Hamlet'' in turn.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt;

=== U.S. Productions ===
A version of ''Fratricide Punished'' was performed at the NADA theater in New York City for the ''Hamlet'' Festival of 1994 alongside a rap version of ''Hamlet'' entitled &quot;The Trage-D of Prince Hammy T.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Arts and Leisure Guide|last=|first=|date=September 11, 1994|work=The New York Times|newspaper=|access-date=|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was directed by Randolph Curtis Rand.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot; /&gt; According to one reviewer, Rand chose to abandon more staid stage interpretations of ''Hamlet'' in order to highlight the comical elements of ''Fratricide Punished''. Toward that end, Hamlet himself was portrayed wearing a loud tuxedo costume reminiscent of [[John Travolta]]'s character in ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' while the characters of the induction were portrayed as though members of [[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McFeely|first=Maureen|year=1995|title=The NADA Hamlet Festival|url=|journal=Shakespeare Bulletin|volume=13|issue=4|pages=11|via=DSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Puppet Productions ====
In 1981, Nino Amico suggested that ''Fratricide Punished'' was a play adapted for performance by puppets, sparking mild academic debate as well as the imagination of theater producers.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; The Hidden Room Theatre company, following up on the extensive research done by Tiffany Stern on Amico's claims, produced a puppet version that included live musical accompaniment and pyrotechnics. The initial production was performed in [[Staunton, Virginia]] at the [[American Shakespeare Center|American Shakespeare Center's]] reproduction of the [[Blackfriars Theatre|Blackfriars Theater]] and went on for a full run in [[Austin, Texas]]. The company also performed ''Fratricide Punished'' at [[Shakespeare's Globe|Shakespeare's Globe Theater]], [[University College, Oxford]], and the [[Shakespeare Institute]], as well as at [[Villanova University]] in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], with a talk from noted Shakespeare scholar Zachary Lesser of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and at other universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hiddenroomtheatre.com/past/der-bestrafte-brudermord-or-hamlet-prince-of-denmark/|title=Der Bestrafte Brudermord|last=|first=|date=|website=The Hidden Room|publisher=The Hidden Room Theater Company|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/artsci/english/newsandevents/hiddenroom.html|title=Hidden Room Theatre—Der Bestrafte Brudermord|last=|first=|date=|website=Liberal Arts and Sciences|publisher=Villanova University|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used a translation provided by Christine Schmidle, who had previously performed a German-language version of ''Fratricide Punished'' at the Center in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt;

The Hidden Room Theatre won multiple awards for their performance, which was renewed for the 2016 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; Despite this success, the central premise of the performance remains unconvincing to some. June Schlueter, responding to Tiffany Stern's article, saw no basis for the assumption that ''Fratricide Punished'' was a play designed for puppets. Instead, she claims that the elements which lend themselves to puppets, such as the plays slapstick humor and physicality, are the result of actors adapting the work to make it more accessible beyond language barriers—a theme that Christine Schmidle also explored in her German language production of the play.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schlueter|first=June|year=2014|title=No Puppets Dallying: Green's 1626 Production of Hamlet|url=|journal=Shakespeare Bulletin|volume=32.4|pages=613–628|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== German Language Production ====
''Fratricide Punished'' was performed in German at the American Shakespeare Center in 2010. The performance was conceived by Christine Schmidle, who would go on to translate the play for the 2015 puppet show there. Schmidle, like many scholars, believed the work to be the result of English comedic actors touring continental Europe in the late 1500s. By performing the play in German to an English speaking audience, she hoped to replicate (albeit in reverse) the kind of problems that those actors would have experienced in conveying meaning across language barriers. In an essay published by the ''[[Shakespeare Bulletin]]'', Schmidle described the kinds of abridgments and added physicality that her troupe undertook in creating a play that would be accessible to the audience. Ultimately, she decided that ''Fratricide Punished'' represented a kind of road map to the play's origins, and that her performance clearly demonstrated that the differences existing between ''Hamlet'' and the text were made entirely in order to better convey meaning.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion'''''|コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュ|Kōdo Giasu: Hangyaku no Rurūshu}}, often referred to as simply ''Code Geass'', is a Japanese [[anime]] [[Television program|series]] created by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]], directed by [[Gorō Taniguchi]], and written by [[Ichirō Ōkouchi]], with original character designs by manga authors [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]]. Set in an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]], the series focuses on how the former prince [[Lelouch Lamperouge|Lelouch vi Britannia]] obtains a power known as Geass and decides to use it to obliterate the Holy Britannian Empire, a [[superpower]] that has been conquering various countries.

''Code Geass'' first ran in Japan on [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]] from October 5, 2006, to July 28, 2007. Its sequel series, {{Nihongo|'''''Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2'''''|コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュR2|Kōdo Giasu Hangyaku no Rurūshu Āru Tsū}}, ran as a simulcast on [[Japan News Network|JNN]] stations (like MBS and [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]) from April 6, 2008 to September 28, 2008. The series has also been adapted into various [[manga]] and [[light novel]]s with the former showing various alternate scenarios from the TV series. [[Bandai Entertainment]] also licensed most parts from the franchise for English release in December 2007, airing the two TV series on [[Adult Swim]]. Most manga and light novels have also been published in North America by Bandai. At the ''Code Geass'' 10th anniversary event on November 27, 2016, it was announced that the series will be receiving a new anime, along with a compilation film trilogy in 2017 that will recap the events from both seasons of the anime series. The new anime, titled {{Nihongo|'''''Code Geass: Lelouch of the Resurrection'''''|コードギアス　復活のルルーシュ|Kōdo Giasu: Fukkatsu no Rurūshu}}, will take place a few years after the events of the Zero Requiem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-11-27/code-geass-gets-new-sequel-and-anime-compilation-film-trilogy/.109224|title=Code Geass Gets New Sequel &amp; Anime Compilation Film Trilogy|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director [[Gorō Taniguchi]] commented that the upcoming project would star an alive Lelouch and not as an alternate setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/11/27/code-geass-compilation-movies-to-prepare-for-new-sequel?referrer=community|title=&quot;Code Geass&quot; Compilation Movies To Prepare For New Sequel|publisher=[[Crunchyroll]]|date=November 28, 2016|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nagamedigital.com/2016/11/28/code-geass-lelouch-of-the-resurrection/|title=Code Geass Lelouch of the Resurrection &amp; Lead Up Compilation Movie Announced|publisher=nagamedigital.com|date=November 28, 2016|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Released to critical acclaim, the anime television series has been well received in Japan, selling over a million DVD and Blu-ray Disc volumes. Both seasons have won several awards at the [[Tokyo International Anime Fair]], ''[[Animage]]'' Anime Grand Prix, and [[Animation Kobe]] event. Critics have highly acclaimed the series for its large audience appeal, story, unique combination of genres, well-written characters, mature themes, as well as the cross conflicts shown among the main characters and the moral questions presented.

==Plot==
{{See also|List of Code Geass characters}}
&lt;!-- Please do not add 55 years differences - official date is 2017 a.t.b. as Revolution Year 228. Revolution Year is started on Storming of the Bastille, 2017-228=1789. --&gt;
The story is set in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative timeline]] where the world is divided into three [[superpower]]s: the Holy Britannian Empire (the Americas; also called Britannia), the Chinese Federation (Asia), and the European Union (Europe and Africa; previously known as the Euro-Universe. Also known as Europa United in ''Akito the Exiled''). The story takes place after the Holy Britannian Empire's conquest of Japan on August 10, 2010 a.t.b., by means of Britannia's newest weapon, the &quot;Autonomous Armored Knight&quot;, or &quot;Knightmare Frame&quot;. In turn, Britannia effectively strips Japan and its citizens of all rights and freedoms and renames the country Area 11 with its citizens referred to as Elevens.

[[Lelouch vi Britannia]] is an exiled Britannian prince, son of Emperor [[Charles zi Britannia]] and his royal consort [[Marianne vi Britannia]]. Lelouch has one sister, [[Nunnally vi Britannia]]. Marianne was brutally murdered in the palace and Nunnally, who witnessed the murder of their mother, was so traumatized she lost both her sight and ability to walk. Lelouch is furious with his father, believing his father failed his mother and sister by turning a blind's eye to their mother's death and failing to pursue their mother's killer. 

The story begins with Lelouch and Nunnally being sent as political pawns to Japan to lull the Japanese government into a false sense of security. After the siblings are sent to Japan, Japan is attacked and defeated by Britannia. With the ruins of Japan as a background, Lelouch vows to his Japanese friend [[Suzaku Kururugi]] that he will one day obliterate Britannia as an act of vengeance against his father.

Seven years later, Lelouch (now going by the name Lelouch Lamperouge), is now a popular yet withdrawn student at Ashford Academy. Lelouch becomes involved in a terrorist attack and finds a mysterious girl called [[C.C. (Code Geass)|C.C.]] (C2), who saves Lelouch's life from the Britannian Royal Guard, by making a contract with him and granting Lelouch a power known as {{nihongo|Geass|ギアス|Giasu}}. This power, also known as the {{nihongo|&quot;Power of Kings&quot;|王の力|Ō no Chikara}}, allows him to command anyone to do whatever he wants, including bending their will to live, fight, or die on his behalf.  This power can affect an individual just once and only through direct eye contact. Lelouch decides to use his Geass to find his mother's murderers, destroy the Britannian Empire, and create a better world where Nunnally can live happily. In the process, Lelouch becomes Zero, a masked vigilante and the leader of the resistance movement known as The Black Knights, gaining popularity and support among the Japanese on his way towards the rebellion of Britannia. However, this does not come without a cost. Caught up in a conflict where he does not know the full extent of his powers, Lelouch will have to battle Suzaku, a resistance member named [[Kallen Stadtfeld]], the strongest army in the world, his own half-siblings, and many others in a battle that will forever change the world.

==Production==
''Code Geass'' began as a concept developed at Sunrise by [[Ichirō Ōkouchi]] and [[Gorō Taniguchi]], who proposed it to producer Yoshitaka Kawaguchi. Kawaguchi had previously approached Okouchi and Taniguchi during the production of ''[[Planetes]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ōkouchi-interview&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Ichirō Ōkouchi|work=Code Geass DVD Volume 1|publisher=[[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea for the plot consisted of a &quot;hero&quot; who led a secret organization, which was later developed into a conflict between two characters with different values and who belonged to the same military unit, who eventually became [[Lelouch Lamperouge]] and [[Suzaku Kururugi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ōkouchi-interview&quot; /&gt;

During these initial planning stages, Kawaguchi also contacted the noted [[Mangaka|manga artist]] group [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ōkouchi-interview&quot;/&gt; This was the first time Clamp had ever been requested to design the characters of an anime series.&lt;ref name=&quot;taniguchi-ōkawa-interview&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Gorō Taniguchi and [[Nanase Ohkawa|Ageha Ōkawa]], head writer of [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]]|work=[[Newtype]], May 2007 issue}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clamp signed onto the project early during these development stages and provided numerous ideas, which helped develop the series' setting and characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;taniguchi-ōkawa-interview&quot;/&gt;

While developing the character designs for Lelouch, the protagonist of the series, Clamp had originally conceived of his hair color as being white.&lt;ref name=&quot;taniguchi-ōkawa-interview&quot;/&gt; [[Nanase Ohkawa|Ageha Ohkawa]], head writer at Clamp, said she had visualized him as being a character to which &quot;everyone&quot; could relate to as being &quot;cool&quot;, literally, a &quot;beauty&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;taniguchi-ōkawa-interview&quot;/&gt; During these planning stages, Clamp and the Sunrise staff had discussed a number of possible inspirations for the characters, including [[KinKi Kids]] and [[Tackey &amp; Tsubasa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;taniguchi-ōkawa-interview&quot;/&gt; They had wanted to create a &quot;hit show,&quot; a series which would appeal to &quot;everyone.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;taniguchi-ōkawa-interview&quot;/&gt; Lelouch's alter ego, Zero, was one of the earliest developed characters, with Ōkouchi having wanted a mask to be included as a part of the series, feeling it was necessary for it to be a Sunrise show, and Clamp wanting a unique design never prior seen in any Sunrise series (said mask was nicknamed &quot;[[tulip]]&quot; for its distinctive design).&lt;ref name=&quot;taniguchi-ōkawa-interview&quot;/&gt;

The concept for the Geass may have been inspired by the Irish and Welsh legends of &quot;Geis&quot; or &quot;Geas&quot;. A geis is a compulsion laid on someone to do or not do something. While the geis itself does not lie on any spectrum, the benefits or actions of it may be decidedly benevolent or malevolent. The concept fits in into the wider fictional world and its lore of British inspirations.

Clamp's finalized original character design art, illustrated by its lead artist [[Mokona]], was subsequently converted into animation character designs for the series by Sunrise's character designer [[Takahiro Kimura]], who had previously spent &quot;every day&quot; analyzing Clamp's art and style from their artbooks and manga series.&lt;ref name=&quot;taniguchi-ōkawa-interview&quot;/&gt; In working on the animation character designs, he focused on designing them so as to enable the series' other animators to apply them without deviating from Clamp's original art style.&lt;ref name=&quot;taniguchi-ōkawa-interview&quot;/&gt;

The music for the series was composed by [[Kōtarō Nakagawa]] and [[Hitomi Kuroishi]], who had earlier worked with the series' core staff in ''Planetes'' and Taniguchi's earlier work ''[[Gun X Sword]]''. In addition to the [[incidental music]] featured in each episode, Kuroishi also composed numerous insert songs for the series, including &quot;Stories&quot;, &quot;Masquerade&quot;, &quot;Alone&quot;, and &quot;Innocent Days&quot;, which were each performed by Kuroishi herself, while &quot;Picaresque&quot; and &quot;Callin'&quot; were performed by the [[singer-songwriter]] [[Mikio Sakai]], who had also earlier worked with Nakagawa and Kuroishi in ''Planetes''. The bands [[Flow (band)|FLOW]], [[Ali Project]], [[Jinn (band)|Jinn]], [[SunSet Swish]], [[Access (group)|Access]], and [[Orange Range]] have provided songs for the opening and ending themes.&lt;ref name=&quot;offsite-cd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geass.jp/cd.html|script-title=ja:コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュ 公式サイト|language=Japanese|accessdate=2007-03-10}}&lt;!--https://web.archive.org/20090618055424/http://www.geass.jp/cd.html--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;flowwe-news&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flow.mu/07/news/detail.php|title=8/13 New Single｢World End｣発売決定!!|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the series was being developed for broadcast on [[Mainichi Broadcasting System]], it had been given the network's Saturday evening [[prime time]] slot, which was later changed to a Thursday [[late night anime|late night time]] slot. Due to this change, the overall outlook and some elements of the series were changed and further developed to suit the more mature, late night audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;ōkouchi-interview&quot;/&gt; The supernatural &quot;Geass&quot; ability finally came into the show at this point and was first conceived as a special power granted by an &quot;angel&quot; to the main characters, though this last part was also modified.&lt;ref name=&quot;ōkouchi-interview&quot; /&gt;

The official website for the first Nintendo DS game launched on July 16, 2007, with the game being released a few months later on October 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geass-game.jp|script-title=ja:コードギアス ゲームサイト|language=Japanese|accessdate=2007-07-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701114056/http://www.geass-game.jp/|archivedate=2007-07-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second game, titled ''Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion Lost Colors'', was developed for the [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[PlayStation 2]], and released in Japan on March 27, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geass-game.jp/ps/index.html|title=コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュ LOST COLORS|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[visual novel]] game which follows a new protagonist named {{nihongo|Rai|ライ}}, who suffers from amnesia. He has a Geass ability similar to [[Lelouch Lamperouge|Lelouch]]'s, but activated by voice.

The third game for the [[Nintendo DS]] is a collection of minigames featuring [[super deformed]] forms of the characters. The player moves along a board through dice rolls, landing on different spots to activate minigames. The minigames are parody-style events with multiple genres. These include helping Jeremiah grow oranges, racing against C.C. and Shirley in swimming, and a sidescrolling beat-em-up featuring Kallen in Guren-like armor.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}&lt;!-- This would not need citation if the game's name was given. --&gt;

''Code Geass R2'' is slated to appear in [[From Software]] (''[[Demon's Souls]]'', ''[[Armored Core]]'') and [[Banpresto]]'s  [[PlayStation 3]] exclusive [[mecha]] action game ''[[Another Century's Episode R]]'', released in Japan in August 2010 and in which both versions of Suzaku's Lancelot, Lelouch's Shinkiro, both versions of Kallen's Guren, and C.C.'s Akatsuki are playable. A fourth installment of the ACE franchise for the PlayStation Portable, [[Another Century's Episode Portable]], will include Suzaku's Lancelot Albion and Lelouch/Zero's Shinkiro.

''Code Geass'' characters have appeared as costumes in the Japanese version of the PlayStation 3 game ''[[Tales of Graces|Tales of Graces F]]''. These characters are Zero, Suzaku, C.C. and Kallen. These costumes were never released from the US version for unknown reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abyssalchronicles.com/?fn_mode=comments&amp;fn_id=505 |title=New Tales of Graces f Costumes Include a Code Geass Set + Narikiri Dolls |author=a745 |date=November 1, 2010 |work= |publisher=Abyssal Chronicles |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
''Code Geass'' has received best-selling success and broad critical acclaim since its release. Despite the wide variety of mecha designed and prominently featuring in the show, fans of ''Code Geass'' are of a wide variety and not always attracted purely to the Knightmare combat scenes. [[Anime News Network]]'s columnist Todd Ciolek attributes the soaring popularity of ''Code Geass'' to &quot;the series hitting every important fan sector&quot;, with the audience appeal points ranging from a &quot;complex cast of characters and a fast-paced story, told with Goro Taniguchi's capable direction&quot; for &quot;general-interest fans&quot; to &quot;pretty and just-a-little-broken heroes&quot; for &quot;[[yaoi]]-buying female fans&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANN_TC_XB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-x-button/2008-08-13|title=The X Button: Revolutionary Jargon|author=Ciolek, Todd|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2008-08-13|accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Kimlinger also finds that the series &quot;has the skill and energy to carry viewers over the top with it, where they can spend a pleasurable few hours reveling in its melodramatic charms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/code-geass-lelouch-of-the-rebellion/dvd-1 |title=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion DVD 1-2 – Review |publisher=Anime News Network |date= |accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also adds that Taniguchi &quot;executes the excesses of his series with care, skillfully intercutting events as Lelouch's plans come together (or fall apart) and using kinetic mecha combat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/code-geass/lelouch-of-the-rebellion/dvd-part-3 |title=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion DVD Part 3 – Review |publisher=Anime News Network |date= |accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlo Santos of Anime News Network wrote that the franchise &quot;in a way, [...] reflects the [[malaise]] of a generation: the realization that old, rich, powerful people have screwed up the world and that the young are helpless to do anything about it&quot;. According to him, Lelouch's actions exemplify the wish to see problems like &quot;[[economic collapse]], [[class conflict]], political instability, [[extremism|radical extremism]]&quot; solved by &quot;Zero's [[vigilante]] methods&quot; but Santos expresses doubt in such an approach and concludes that &quot;the series is at its best when raising questions rather than offering a final solution&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANN_G1_rev&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/code-geass-lelouch-of-the-rebellion/gn-1|title=''Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion GN 1-2'' – Review|author=Santos, Carlo|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2008-09-28|accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; T.H.E.M. Anime Reviewer Dallas Marshall gave the series 4 out of 5 stars, stating &quot;A melodramatic piece of science fiction that has more than enough going for it in terms of action and visuals but tends to go overboard with its emotionalism. If this minor flaw can be overlooked, there is an epic story to be told with a rather intriguing main character at the helm. Take away one star if that minor 'flaw' cannot be ignored.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=1486|title=Code Geass|publisher=T.H.E.M Anime Reviews|accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Snow White and the Huntsman''''' is a 2012 American [[fantasy film]] based on the German fairy tale &quot;[[Snow White]]&quot; compiled by the [[Brothers Grimm]]. The film is the [[directorial debut]] of [[Rupert Sanders]]. The screenplay was by [[Evan Daugherty]], [[John Lee Hancock]], and [[Hossein Amini]], from a screen story by Daugherty. In the film's retelling of the tale, Snow White grows up imprisoned by her evil stepmother, [[Queen (Snow White)|Queen Ravenna]], a powerful sorceress. After Snow White escapes into the forest, Ravenna tells [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Eric, the Huntsman]] that she will bring back his dead wife if he captures Snow White.

The cast includes [[Kristen Stewart]] as Snow White, [[Charlize Theron]] as Queen Ravenna, [[Chris Hemsworth]] as Eric, the huntsman, [[Sam Claflin]] as William, Snow White's childhood friend, and [[Bob Hoskins]] as the dwarf [[Premonition|seer]] in his final film appearances. The film received two [[Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] at the [[85th Academy Awards]]. It was a success at the box office, earning $396.6 million worldwide against a $170 million budget. Although critics praised the production design, visual effects, Theron and Hemsworth's performances, musical score, and action sequences; Stewart and Claflin's performances received mixed reviews, and the screenplay was heavily criticized.

A [[prequel]]/[[sequel]], titled ''[[The Huntsman: Winter's War]]'', directed by the first film's visual effects supervisor [[Cedric Nicolas-Troyan]], was released on April 22, 2016, with Stewart (only through the use of archive footage), Hemsworth, Theron, Claflin and [[Nick Frost]] reprising their roles.

==Plot==
While admiring a rose blooming in the winter, Queen Eleanor of the kingdom of Tabor pricks her finger on one of its thorns. Three drops of blood fall onto the snow-covered ground, and she wishes for a daughter as white as the snow, with lips as red as the blood, hair as black as a raven's wings and a heart as strong and defiant as the rose. Queen Eleanor gives birth to her daughter [[Snow White]], but soon after falls ill and dies. After her death, Snow White's father, [[King (Snow White)|King Magnus]], and his army battle an invading Dark Army of demonic glass soldiers. Upon rescuing their prisoner Ravenna, he becomes enchanted with her beauty and marries her.

[[Queen (Snow White)|Ravenna]] is in fact a powerful sorceress and the Dark Army's master. On their wedding night, Magnus, enchanted, throws Ravenna into the bed and proceeds to make love. Ravenna confesses there was a king much like Magnus that hurt her. During foreplay, she declares she cannot be a weak queen and kills Magnus before unleashing her invading army upon the kingdom. Snow White's childhood friend William and his father Duke Hammond escape the castle but are unable to rescue her, and she is captured by Ravenna's brother Finn and locked away in the north tower of the castle for many years.

Tabor is ruined under Queen Ravenna's rule as she periodically drains the youth from the kingdom's young women in order to maintain a spell cast over her as a child by her mother which allows her to keep her youthful beauty. When Snow White comes of age, Queen Ravenna learns from her [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]], in the form of a golden, reflective liquid shaped like a man, that her stepdaughter Snow White is destined to destroy her unless Queen Ravenna consumes the young girl's heart, which will make her truly immortal. Queen Ravenna orders Finn to bring her Snow White's heart, but Snow White escapes into the Dark Forest, where Ravenna has no power. Queen Ravenna makes a bargain with [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Eric the Huntsman]], a widower and drunkard, to capture Snow White, promising to bring his wife back to life in exchange. The Huntsman tracks down Snow White, but when Finn reveals that Queen Ravenna does not actually have the power to do what she promised, the Huntsman fights him and his men while Snow White runs away. When the Huntsman catches up with her, she promises him gold if he will escort her to Duke Hammond's castle. Meanwhile, Finn gathers another band of men to find her, and Duke Hammond and his son William learn that she is alive. William leaves the castle on his own to find her, joining Finn's band as a [[Archery|bowman]].

The Huntsman and Snow White leave the Dark Forest, where she saves his life by charming a huge troll that attacks them. They make their way to a fishing village populated by women who have disfigured themselves to save their own lives, becoming useless to Queen Ravenna, who wants to use their beauty and youth to extend and prolong hers, as she does with Gretta whilst Snow White is still imprisoned. While there, the Huntsman learns Snow White's true identity, and initially leaves her in the care of the women. He soon returns when he sees the village being burned down by Finn's men. Snow White and the Huntsman evade them and eventually meet a band of [[Seven Dwarfs|eight dwarves]] named Beith, Muir, Quert, Coll, Duir, Gort, Nion, and Gus. The blind Muir perceives that Snow White is the daughter of the former king, and the only person who can defeat Ravenna and end her reign.

As they travel through a [[fairy]] sanctuary, Snow White encounters a magical reindeer that was only in tales of legend, but as the reindeer and Snow White are about to embrace, the group is attacked by Finn and his men. The Huntsman battles Finn and eventually kills him, and William reveals himself and helps defeat Finn's men. However, Gus is killed when he sacrifices himself to take an arrow meant for Snow White. William joins the group which continues the journey to Hammond's castle.

Halfway to Duke Hammond's castle, Queen Ravenna disguises herself as William and tempts Snow White into eating a poisoned apple, but is forced to flee when the Huntsman and William discover her. William kisses Snow White, whom he believes to be dead and does not notice a tear fall from one of her eyes. She is taken to Hammond's castle. As she lies in repose, the Huntsman professes his regret for not saving Snow White, who reminds him of his late wife, Sara; and he kisses her, not noticing a second tear coming from her other eye falling. The spell broken by the love of two men she treasures, Snow White awakens and walks into the courtyard; rallying the Duke's army to mount a siege against Queen Ravenna.

The dwarves infiltrate the castle through the sewers and open the gates, allowing the Duke's army inside. Snow White confronts Queen Ravenna, but is overpowered. Queen Ravenna is about to kill Snow White and consume her heart. Eventually, Snow White uses a move the Huntsman taught her and mortally wounds Queen Ravenna, and Duke Hammond's army is victorious. With Queen Ravenna defeated, the kingdom once again enjoys peace and harmony as Snow White is crowned queen.

[[File:Charlize Theron &amp; Kristen Stewart by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Theron &amp; Stewart at [[Wondercon]] 2012 in Anaheim, California on March 2012.]]

'''''Alice in Wonderland''''' is a 2010 American [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[adventure film]] directed by [[Tim Burton]] from a screenplay written by [[Linda Woolverton]]. The film stars [[Johnny Depp]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], [[Crispin Glover]], [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] and [[Mia Wasikowska]], and features the voices of [[Alan Rickman]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Michael Sheen]], and [[Timothy Spall]]. Based on [[Lewis Carroll]]'s fantasy novels, ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', the film tells the story of a nineteen-year-old [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice Kingsleigh]], who is told that she can restore the [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]] to her throne, with the help of the [[Hatter (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Mad Hatter]]. She is the only one who can slay the [[Jabberwocky|Jabberwock]], a dragon-like creature that is controlled by the [[Red Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|Red Queen]] and terrorizes Underland's inhabitants.

The film was produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and shot in the United Kingdom and the United States. The film premiered in London at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on February 25, 2010, and was released in Australia on March 4, 2010, and the following day in the United Kingdom and the United States through the [[Disney Digital 3-D|Disney Digital 3D]], [[RealD 3D]], and [[IMAX 3D]] formats as well as in conventional theaters. It is also the [[2010 in film|second-highest-grossing film of 2010.]]

''Alice in Wonderland'' received mixed reviews upon release; although praised for its visual style and special effects, the film was criticized for its lack of narrative coherence and overuse of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). At the [[83rd Academy Awards]], ''Alice in Wonderland'' won [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], and was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. The film generated over $1 billion in ticket sales and became the [[List of highest-grossing films|fifth-highest-grossing film of all time]] during its theatrical run.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;Corliss, Richard (May 13, 2012).

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film started [[List of Disney live-action adaptation of animated films|a trend of live-action fairy tale and fantasy films]] being green-lit, particularly from [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]].

A sequel, titled ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016 film)|Alice Through the Looking Glass]]'', was released on May 27, 2016.

==Plot==
Troubled by a strange recurring dream and mourning the loss of her father, 19-year-old [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice Kingsleigh]] attends a garden party at Lord Ascot's estate. There, she is confronted by an unwanted marriage proposal to Lord Ascot's son, Hamish, and the stifling expectations of the society in which she lives. Unsure of how to proceed, she pursues a rabbit wearing a blue waistcoat and accidentally falls into a large rabbit hole under a tree. She emerges in a forest where she is greeted by the [[White Rabbit]], [[the Dormouse]], the [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dodo]], the [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#Live Flowers|Talking Flowers]], and [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee|Tweedledee and Tweedledum]]. They argue over whether Alice is &quot;the right Alice&quot; who must slay the [[Red Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|Red Queen]]'s [[Jabberwocky]] and restore the [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]] to power, as foretold by [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Absolem the Caterpillar]] and his prophetic scroll. The group is then ambushed by the [[Bandersnatch]] and a group of playing-card soldiers led by the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]]. Alice, Tweedledum and Tweedledee escape into the woods. The Knave steals the Caterpillar's scroll. The Dormouse leaves the others behind with one of the Bandersnatch's eyes in her possession. Tweedledum and Tweedledee are then captured by the Red Queen's [[Jubjub bird]].

The Knave informs the Red Queen that Alice threatens her reign, and the soldiers and [[Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Bayard the Bloodhound]] are ordered to find Alice immediately. Meanwhile, the [[Cheshire Cat]] guides the [[March Hare]] and the [[Hatter (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Mad Hatter]]. The Hatter helps Alice avoid capture by allowing himself to be seized instead. Later, Alice is found by the Bloodhound, but Alice insists upon helping the Hatter. At the Red Queen's citadel and palace, the Red Queen is unaware of Alice's true identity and therefore welcomes her as a guest. Alice learns that the [[vorpal sword]], the only weapon capable of killing the Jabberwocky, is locked inside the den of the Bandersnatch. The Knave attempts to seduce Alice, but she rebuffs him, causing a jealous Red Queen to order that Alice be beheaded. Alice obtains the sword and befriends the Bandersnatch by returning its eye. She then escapes on the back of the grateful Bandersnatch and delivers the sword to the White Queen. The Cheshire Cat saves the Hatter from the [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#The Executioner|executioner]], and the Hatter calls for rebellion against the Red Queen. The rebellion is quickly put down by the Jubjub bird, but the resistance flees to the White Queen's castle, and both armies prepare for battle. Absolem advises Alice to fight the Jabberwocky just before completing his transformation into a [[pupa]].

On the appointed day, the White Queen and the Red Queen gather their armies on a chessboard-like battlefield and send Alice and the Jabberwocky to decide the battle in single combat. Encouraged by the advice of her late father, Alice fights the Jabberwocky among the ruins surrounding the battlefield and finally jumps from the remains of a spiral staircase onto the Jabberwocky's neck and beheads it. During this fight, a falling masonry stone kills the Jubjub bird. As punishment for their crimes, the White Queen banishes the Red Queen and the Knave into exile together. The Knave attempts to kill the Red Queen, yet the White Queen graciously protects the Red Queen from his attack. After the Hatter performs a celebration dance called Futterwacken, the White Queen gives Alice a vial of the Jabberwocky's purple blood whose power will bring her whatever she wishes. She decides to rejoin the everyday world after saying farewell to his friends. Back in England, Lord Ascot takes Alice as his apprentice with the idea of establishing oceanic trade routes to [[Hong Kong]]. As the story closes, Alice prepares to set off on a trading ship. A light-blue butterfly with dark vein markings lands on her shoulder, and Alice recognizes him as Absolem.

[[File:Queen of hearts 2010.jpg|thumb|250px|Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen. Bonham Carter's head was digitally increased to three times its original size in the film.]]
* [[Mia Wasikowska]] as [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice &lt;!-- KINGSLEIGH is the official canon spelling. Do not change.--&gt;Kingsleigh]]. When creating the character, screenwriter Linda Woolverton researched how young women were expected to behave in the Victorian era and then made her the opposite.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytfeb2610&quot;/&gt; Wasikowska read Carroll's books as a child and re-read them to prepare for her role. She also watched [[Jan Švankmajer]]'s ''[[Alice (1988 film)|Alice]]''. She said, &quot;When we were kids, my mum would pop it in the VCR player. We would be disturbed, and wouldn't really understand it, but we couldn't look away because it was too intriguing. So I had kept that feeling about Alice, a kind of haunting feeling.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SundayTimes&quot;/&gt; Although facing pressures to conform to society's expectations, Alice grows into a stronger-willed and empowered heroine who chooses her own path; ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' columnist Liz Hoggard praised Alice as a role model for girls, describing the character as &quot;stubborn, brave, [and] non-girlie&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytfeb2610&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Liz |last=Hoggard |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/liz-hoggard-revenge-of-the-lifesavvy-over40s-1909603.html |title=Liz Hoggard: Revenge of the life-savvy over-40s: Burton's Alice – a role model for girls of 2010 |work=[[The Independent]] |date=February 25, 2010 |accessdate=February 27, 2010 |location=London |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGSWujj1?url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/liz-hoggard-revenge-of-the-lifesavvy-over40s-1909603.html |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mairi Ella Challen portrayed Alice as a six-year-old girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dave |last=Taylor |title=Review: &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; |url=http://www.daveonfilm.com/review-alice-in-wonderland-9333.html |work=Dave On Film |date=March 5, 2010 |accessdate=March 26, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGSYYaYw?url=http://www.daveonfilm.com/review-alice-in-wonderland-9333.html |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Tarrant Hightopp]], [[The Hatter|The Mad Hatter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;script&quot;/&gt; Wasikowska said that the characters, &quot;both feel like outsiders and feel alone in their separate worlds, and have a special bond and friendship.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;'Alice in Wonderland'' star Mia Wasikowska on Johnny Depp: 'He's so brave and smart&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;confirm&quot;/&gt; Burton explained that Depp &quot;tried to find a grounding to the character … as opposed to just being mad.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sdcc09&quot;/&gt; Burton also said that, &quot;In a lot of versions it's a very one-note kind of character and you know [Depp's] goal was to try and bring out a human side to the strangeness of the character.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sdcc09&quot;/&gt; The orange hair is an allusion to the [[Erethism|mercury poisoning suffered by hatters]] who used mercury to cure felt; Depp believes that the character &quot;was poisoned … and it was coming out through his hair, through his fingernails and eyes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnny Depp explains how he picked his poison with the Mad Hatter&quot;/&gt; Depp and Burton decided that the Hatter's clothes, skin, hair, personality and accent would change throughout the film to reflect his emotions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnny Depp is Mad&quot;/&gt; In an interview with Depp, the character was paralleled to &quot;a [[mood ring]], [as] his emotions are ''very'' close to the surface&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnny Depp Sets Sail on Fourth ''Pirates'' Movie&quot;/&gt; The Hatter is [[Dissociative identity disorder|&quot;made up of different people and their extreme sides&quot;]], with a gentle voice much like the character's creator [[Lewis Carroll]] reflecting the lighter personality and with a Scottish [[Glasgow patter|Glaswegian]] accent (which Depp modeled after [[Gregor Fisher]]'s ''[[Rab C.

* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as Iracebeth of Crims, the Red Queen. She is an amalgamation of two Carroll characters: the [[Red Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|Red Queen]] and the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;script&quot;/&gt; Her first name is a play on the word [[wiktionary:irascible|irascible]] because she is easily irritated, obstreperous, impatient, and quick to anger.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday.com&quot;/&gt; Bonham Carter's head was digitally increased to three times its original size on screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;glove&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;animation&quot;/&gt; The character hates animals, and chooses to use them as servants and furniture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alice in Wonderland: The curious one that will get the kids screaming...&quot;/&gt; It is implied that the Red Queen beheaded her former husband, the King. The actress took inspiration from her young daughter Nell, a toddler, stating that, &quot;The Red Queen is just like a toddler, because she's got a big head and she's a [[tyrant]].&quot;
* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Mirana of Marmoreal, the [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;script&quot;/&gt; She was one of few characters that did not require digital manipulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tim Burton Takes on ''Alice in Wonderland''&quot;/&gt; Hathaway summed up her character with a caption on a magnet of [[It's Happy Bunny|Happy Bunny]] holding a knife; &quot;Cute but psycho. Things even out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Brian |last=Jacks |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/12/09/anne-hathaways-alice-in-wonderland-white-queen-cute-but-psycho/ |title=Anne Hathaway's ''Alice In Wonderland'' White Queen: &quot;Cute But Psycho&quot; |date=December 9, 2008 |work=MTV Movies Blog |publisher=[[Viacom]] |accessdate=December 9, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGSZMBQu?url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/12/09/anne-hathaways-alice-in-wonderland-white-queen-cute-but-psycho/ |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hathaway, &quot;She comes from the same gene pool as the Red Queen. She really likes the dark side, but she's so scared of going too far into it that she's made everything appear very light and happy. But she's living in that place out of fear that she won't be able to control herself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;darkside&quot;/&gt; Hathaway described her interpretation of the White Queen as &quot;a [[punk rock|punk-rock]] [[veganism|vegan]] [[pacifism|pacifist]]&quot;, with inspiration drawn from [[Debbie Harry]], [[Greta Garbo]], and the artwork of [[Dan Flavin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;darkside&quot;/&gt; Burton said that the White Queen's appearance was inspired by [[Nigella Lawson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tim Burton's White Queen Based on Nigella Lawson&quot;/&gt;
* [[Crispin Glover]] played Ilosovic Stayne, the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;script&quot;/&gt; The Knave of Hearts is arrogant and tricky. While he follows the Red Queen's every order, he is the only one capable of calming her dramatic mood swings. Glover said, &quot;The Red Queen has a fair amount of short-tempered reactions to things that people do, and so [the Knave] has to be quite diplomatic.&quot; The Red Queen believes that the Knave of Hearts is her lover, but this proves to be false.
* [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] portrayed both [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee|Tweedledee and Tweedledum]]. Burton commented on the mixture of animation and Lucas, saying that &quot;It's a weird mixture of things which gives his characters the disturbing quality that they so richly deserve.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/02/tim-burton-took-a-shining-to-tweedledee-and-tweedledum-.html |title=Tim Burton took a &quot;Shining&quot; to Tweedledee and Tweedledum |last=Boucher |first=Geoff |date=February 9, 2010 |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Tribune Company |accessdate=February 21, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGSbAhHp?url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/02/tim-burton-took-a-shining-to-tweedledee-and-tweedledum-.html |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The characters are portrayed through a combination of CGI and live-action, with Lucas's face digitally composited to a full animated body. While performing the character, Lucas had to wear a teardrop-shaped motion capture suit and walk on stilts. In order to play both characters, Lucas was doubled by [[Ethan Cohn]].
* [[Frances de la Tour]] as Imogene, Alice's aunt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Louisville Mojo&quot;/&gt; She is suffering from severe delusions and is constantly awaiting her fictional fiancé whom she believes to be a prince.
* [[Leo Bill]] as Hamish Ascot, Alice's would-be fiancé.&lt;ref name=&quot;Louisville Mojo&quot;/&gt;

[[Marton Csokas]] makes a cameo appearance as Alice's deceased father in the film's opening scene and Alice's mother is played by [[Lindsay Duncan]]. Lord and Lady Ascot are played by [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] and [[Geraldine James]], respectively. [[Eleanor Tomlinson]] and Eleanor Gecks play the Cathaway sisters, who bear a strong resemblance to Tweedledum and Tweedledee. [[Jemma Powell]] appears briefly as Alice's sister, Margaret, while Margaret's unfaithful husband Lowell is played by [[John Hopkins (actor)|John Hopkins]].

===Voice cast===
* [[Michael Sheen]] voiced Nivens McTwisp, the [[White Rabbit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;script&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Actor Sheen in Wonderland&quot;/&gt; Sheen said the character &quot;is such an iconic character that [he] didn't feel like [he] should break the mold too much.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Sheen on White Rabbit&quot;/&gt; Burton said the quality he wanted most in his clock-watching bunny was a twitchiness, also commenting that &quot;[in] any incarnation of the [White Rabbit] through the years, there's that sort of nervousness of a rabbit.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Sheen on White Rabbit&quot;/&gt;
* [[Alan Rickman]] voiced Absolem, the [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Caterpillar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;script&quot;/&gt; Rickman was originally going to have his face composited onto the animated Caterpillar. He was filmed recording his voice in the studio, but the idea was eventually scrapped. The animators did, however, try to give Absolem's face characteristics similar to Rickman's.&lt;ref name=&quot;animation&quot;/&gt;
* [[Stephen Fry]] voiced Chess, the [[Cheshire Cat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;script&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Five Minutes With: Stephen Fry&quot;/&gt; Burton stated that the character had a creepy quality in addition to tapping into his own hatred of cats.&lt;ref name=&quot;daily cast&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Cheshire Cat taps into...my hatred of cats&quot;/&gt; The role was intended to be played by Michael Sheen but he changed his role to the White Rabbit due to scheduling conflicts.
* [[Barbara Windsor]] voiced Mallymkun, the [[Dormouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dormouse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;script&quot;/&gt; Burton said that he sought after Windsor for the role because he was a fan of her TV show ''[[EastEnders]]''. Her voice sealed the deal for her role as the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/02/tim-burton-says-wonderland-has-a-national-treasure-in-barbara-windsor-.html |title=Tim Burton says ''Alice'' has &quot;a national treasure&quot; in Barbara Windsor |date=February 14, 2010 |last=Boucher |first=Geoff |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |accessdate=February 21, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGSctkNa?url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/02/tim-burton-says-wonderland-has-a-national-treasure-in-barbara-windsor-.html |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Timothy Spall]] voiced Bayard, the [[Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Bloodhound]]. Although Bayard does not appear in the book, a similar character named The Puppy is likely the inspiration for the character.
* [[Paul Whitehouse]] voiced Thackery Earwicket, the [[March Hare]].&lt;ref name=&quot;script&quot;/&gt; Burton stated that because Whitehouse is a great comedic actor, a lot of his lines came from [[improvisation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alice in Wonderland: A Visual Companion&quot;/&gt;
* [[Michael Gough]] voiced Uilleam, the [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dodo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;script&quot;/&gt; Burton said that Gough was the first person he thought of for the role of the Dodo because he has &quot;a full life quality to his voice&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alice in Wonderland: A Visual Companion1&quot;/&gt; The character only speaks three lines, that Gough recorded in a day. This would be Gough's final acting role; he died a year after its release, aged 94. Gough had previously portrayed the March Hare in the [[Alice in Wonderland (1966 TV play)|1966 TV play]] of the book.
* [[Christopher Lee]] voiced the [[Jabberwock]]. While it only had two lines, Burton said that he felt Lee to be a good match for the iconic character because he is &quot;an iconic guy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alice in Wonderland: A Visual Companion2&quot;/&gt; For the character, Lee had originally tried to make his voice &quot;burble&quot; (as described in the poem &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;). However, Burton convinced him to use his actual voice, as he found it more intimidating and aggressive.
* [[Imelda Staunton]] voiced the [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#Live Flowers|Tall Flower Faces]]. Though there are many flowers that appear around Underland, only one of them speaks and one of them is clearly a [[caricature]] of Staunton.&lt;ref name=&quot;presskit&quot;/&gt; Staunton only speaks three lines that are heard very briefly at the beginning of the film.
* [[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]] voiced the [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#The Executioner|Red Queen's executioner]]. The Executioner only speaks one line and appears extremely briefly, though Carter also voiced several other servants to the Red Queen.
[[Frank Welker]] provided additional voices and vocal effects; including roars of the [[Jabberwocky]] and [[Bandersnatch]], squawks for the [[Jubjub bird]], and Bayard barking.&lt;ref name=&quot;presskit&quot;/&gt; Rickman, Windsor, Fry, Gough, Lee, Staunton and Carter each took only a day to record their dialogue.&lt;ref name=&quot;presskit&quot;/&gt;

Burton and Bonham Carter's children Billy and Nell made cameo appearances as a boy and baby at the dock in the end of the film.

==Production==
[[Tim Burton]] signed with [[Walt Disney Pictures]] to direct two films in [[Disney Digital 3-D|Disney Digital 3D]], which included ''Alice in Wonderland''&lt;ref name=&quot;Graser&quot;/&gt; and [[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|his remake of ''Frankenweenie'']]. Burton developed the story because he never felt an emotional tie to [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|the original book]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryder&quot;/&gt;

He explained &quot;the goal is to try to make it an engaging movie where you get some of the psychology and kind of bring a freshness but also keep the classic nature of ''Alice''.&quot; On prior versions, Burton said &quot;It was always a girl wandering around from one crazy character to another, and I never really felt any real emotional connection.&quot; His goal with the new film is to give the story &quot;some framework of emotional grounding&quot; and &quot;to try and make ''Alice'' feel more like a story as opposed to a series of events.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sdcc09&quot;/&gt; Burton focused on the poem &quot;[[Jabberwocky]]&quot; as part of his structure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Katie |last=Hasty |url=http://www.hitfix.com/articles/2009-7-23-comic-con-tim-burton-talks-alice-and-the-jabberwocky-taking-on-dark-shadows |title=Comic-Con: Tim Burton talks ''Alice'' and the Jabberwocky, taking on &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; |work=Hitfix |date=July 23, 2009 |accessdate=December 25, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGSdtpkH?url=http://www.hitfix.com/articles/2009-7-23-comic-con-tim-burton-talks-alice-and-the-jabberwocky-taking-on-dark-shadows |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the described creature by the name of the poem rather than by the name &quot;Jabberwock&quot; used in the poem. Burton also stated that he does not see his version as either a sequel to any existing ''Alice'' film nor as a &quot;re-imagining&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryder&quot;/&gt; However, the idea of the climax of the story being Alice's battle with the Queen's champion, the Jabberwocky, was first added in the video game ''[[American McGee's Alice]]'', and the landscape, tower, weapons and appearance of Alice in those scenes of the film are very reminiscent of the same scenes in the game.

==Release==
On February 12, 2010, major UK cinema chains, [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon]], [[Vue Cinemas|Vue]], and [[Cineworld]], had planned to boycott the film because of a reduction of the interval between cinema and DVD [[film release|release]] from the usual 17 weeks to 12 (possibly to avoid the release of the DVD clashing with the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], which was Disney's pretext for cutting short ''Alice''{{'}}s theatrical run but UK exhibitors protested that Alice would be less threatened by the World Cup than other titles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a202872/uk-cinemas-plan-alice-boycott.html |title=Movies – News – UK cinemas plan ''Alice'' boycott |last=Reynolds |first=Simon |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi]] |date=February 12, 2010 |accessdate=February 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGSeFdi4?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a202872/uk-cinemas-plan-alice-boycott.html |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after the announcement, Cineworld, who has a 24% share of UK box office, chose to play the film on more than 150 screens. Cineworld's chief executive Steve Wiener stated, &quot;As leaders in 3D, we did not want the public to miss out on such a visual spectacle.

On June 22, 2009, the first pictures of the film were released, showing Depp as the Mad Hatter, Hathaway as the White Queen, Bonham Carter as the Red Queen and Lucas as Tweedledee and Tweedledum.&lt;ref name=&quot;firstlook&quot;/&gt; A new image of Alice was also released.&lt;ref name=&quot;''Alice in Wonderland'' Stills&quot;/&gt; In July, new photos emerged of Alice holding a white rabbit, the Mad Hatter with a hare, the Red Queen holding a pig, and the White Queen with a mouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Exclusive: New Alice In Wonderland Pic&quot;/&gt;

On July 22, 2009, a [[Teaser campaign|teaser trailer]] from the Mad Hatter's point of view was released on [[IGN]] but was shortly taken down because Disney claimed that the trailer was not supposed to be out yet. The teaser was also planned to premiere along with a trailer of [[Robert Zemeckis]]' [[film adaptation]] of ''[[A Christmas Carol (2009 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'' on July 24, 2009 for ''[[G-Force (film)|G-Force]]''. The following day, the teaser trailer premiered at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] but the trailer shown was different from the one that leaked. The ComicCon version didn't have the Mad Hatter's dialogue. Instead, it featured &quot;[[Time to Pretend]]&quot; by [[MGMT]], and the clips shown were in different order than in the leaked version. The leaked version was originally to be shown to one of the three Facebook groups used to promote the film that had the most members. The groups used to promote the film are &quot;The Loyal Subjects of the Red Queen&quot;, &quot;The Loyal Subjects of the White Queen&quot; and &quot;The Disloyal Subjects of the Mad Hatter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedisneyblog.com/2009/07/21/be-the-first-to-see-the-alice-in-wonderland-teaser-trailer/ |title=Be The First To See The Alice In Wonderland Teaser Trailer! |last=Frost |first=John |publisher=The Disney Blog |date=July 21, 2009 |accessdate=July 21, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGSgUWVi?url=http://thedisneyblog.com/2009/07/21/be-the-first-to-see-the-alice-in-wonderland-teaser-trailer/ |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also at ComicCon, [[Theatrical property|props]] from the film were displayed in an &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; exhibit. Costumes featured in the exhibit included the Red Queen's dress, chair, wig, spectacles, and scepter; the White Queen's dress, wig and a small model of her castle; the Mad Hatter's suit, hat, wig, chair and table; Alice's dress and battle armor (to slay the Jabberwocky). Other props included the &quot;DRINK ME&quot; bottles, the keys, an &quot;EAT ME&quot; pastry and stand-in models of the White Rabbit and March Hare.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alice in Wonderland Props Totally Rock at Comic Con&quot;/&gt;

A nighttime party area at the [[Disney California Adventure]] theme park was created, called &quot;[[Mad T Party]]&quot;.

===Critical reaction===
Review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 52% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 265 reviews; the average score is 5.7/10. The consensus is: &quot;Tim Burton's ''Alice'' sacrifices the book's minimal narrative coherence—and much of its heart—but it's an undeniable visual treat&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alice in Wonderland (2010)3&quot;/&gt; [[Metacritic]] rated it 53/100 based on 38 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/alice-in-wonderland|title=Alice in Wonderland|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=July 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised it for its &quot;moments of delight, humor and bedazzlement&quot;, but went on to say, &quot;But it also becomes more ordinary as it goes along, building to a generic battle climax similar to any number of others in CGI-heavy movies of the past few years&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alice in Wonderland Review&quot;/&gt; Michael Rechtshaffen of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said &quot;Burton has delivered a subversively witty, brilliantly cast, whimsically appointed dazzler that also manages to hit all the emotionally satisfying marks&quot;, while as well praising its [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI), saying &quot;Ultimately, it's the visual landscape that makes Alice's newest adventure so wondrous, as technology has finally been able to catch up with Burton's endlessly fertile imagination.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/alice-in-wonderland-film-review-1004071135.story? |title=Alice in Wonderland – Film Review |last=Rechtshaffen |first=Michael |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media]] |date=February 25, 2010 |accessdate=February 26, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302144251/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/alice-in-wonderland-film-review-1004071135.story |archivedate=March 2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said, &quot;But Burton's Disneyfied 3-D ''Alice in Wonderland'', written by the girl-power specialist Linda Woolverton, is a strange brew indeed: murky, diffuse, and meandering, set not in a Wonderland that pops with demented life but in a world called Underland that's like a joyless, bombed-out version of Wonderland. It looks like a CGI head trip gone post apocalyptic. In the film's rather humdrum 3-D, the place doesn't dazzle—it droops.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20348226,00.html |title=Alice in Wonderland (2010) – Movie Review |date=March 3, 2010 |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |authorlink=Owen Gleiberman |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGSkPOEA?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C20348226%2C00.html |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film three out of four stars and wrote in his review that, &quot;''Alice'' plays better as an adult hallucination, which is how Burton rather brilliantly interprets it until a pointless third act flies off the rails.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alice in Wonderland Review4&quot;/&gt; The market research firm [[CinemaScore]] found that audiences gave the film an average rating of &quot;A-&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ben |last=Fritz |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/03/alice-in-wonderland-opens-to-record-setting-210-million.html |title=First look: ''Alice in Wonderland'' opens to record-setting $210 million |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |date=March 7, 2010 |accessdate=March 7, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGSlPue0?url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/03/alice-in-wonderland-opens-to-record-setting-210-million.html |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reviews criticized the decision to turn Alice into a &quot;colonialist entrepreneur&quot; at the end of the film setting sail for China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alice in Wonderland review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;''Alice in Wonderland in Digital 3-D'' clowns paying audience&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alice in Wonderland review5&quot;/&gt; Given Britain's role in the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s during the [[Victorian era]] and the foreign domination of China through &quot;[[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]]&quot;, China expert Kevin Slaten writes, &quot;Not only is it troubling imagery, for a female role model in a Disney movie, but it's also a celebration of the exploitation that China suffered for a century.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Who else might be mad at Alice? China&quot;/&gt;

Game developer [[American McGee]], best known for creating ''[[American McGee's Alice|Alice]]'' and ''[[Alice: Madness Returns]]'', was asked in a 2011 interview about Tim Burton's interpretation of the title character since both versions share almost similar dark and twisted tone of Wonderland. McGee praised the film's visuals and audio but criticized the lack of screen time Alice had compared to the other characters. He felt Alice did not have any purpose in the story and that she was merely used as a &quot;tool&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Douglas|first1=Jane|title=Alice: Madness Returns Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8j6-jiyHCE|website=YouTube|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Oedipus Rex''''', also known by its Greek title, '''''Oedipus Tyrannus''''' ({{lang-grc|Οἰδίπους Τύραννος}} IPA: [oidípuːs týranːos]), or '''''Oedipus the King''''', is an [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]] by [[Sophocles]] that was first performed around 429 BC.&lt;ref&gt; Although Sophocles won second prize with the group of plays that included ''Oedipus Rex'', its date of production is uncertain. The prominence of the Theban [[Plague (disease)|plague]] at the play's opening suggests to many scholars a reference to the plague that devastated Athens in 430 BC, and hence a production date shortly thereafter. See, for example, {{cite journal|authorlink=Bernard Knox|first=Bernard|last=Knox|title=The Date of the ''Oedipus Tyrannus'' of Sophocles|journal=[[American Journal of Philology]]|volume=77|issue=2|year=1956|pages=133–147|jstor=292475 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, to the ancient Greeks, the title was simply ''Oedipus'' (''Οἰδίπους''), as it is referred to by Aristotle in the [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']].  It is thought to have been renamed ''Oedipus Tyrannus'' to distinguish it from ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]''. In antiquity, the term “tyrant” referred to a ruler, but it did not necessarily have a negative connotation.&lt;ref&gt;Bridgewater, William, ed. &quot;tyrant&quot;. ''The Columbia Encyclopedia''. Columbia University Press. (1963) p. 2188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd-Jones, Hugh. Introduction and trans. ''Sophocles: Ajax, Electra, Oedipus Tyrannus''. By Sophocles. Loeb Classical Library ser. vol. 20. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|978-0674995574}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mulroy, David. trans. “Introduction”. Sophocles, ''Oedipus Rex''. Univ of Wisconsin Press, (2011) {{ISBN|9780299282530}}. p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt;

Of his three Theban plays that have survived, and that deal with the story of [[Oedipus]], ''Oedipus Rex'' was the second to be written. However, in terms of the chronology of events that the plays describe, it comes first, followed by ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' and then ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''.

Prior to the start of ''Oedipus Rex'', [[Oedipus]] has become the king of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] while unwittingly fulfilling a [[prophecy]] that he would kill his father, [[Laius]] (the previous king), and marry his mother, [[Jocasta]] (whom Oedipus took as his queen after solving the [[Sphinx#The Riddle of the Sphinx|riddle of the Sphinx]]). The action of Sophocles' play concerns Oedipus' search for the murderer of Laius in order to end a plague ravaging Thebes, unaware that the killer he is looking for is none other than himself. At the end of the play, after the truth finally comes to light, Jocasta [[Suicide by hanging|hangs herself]] while Oedipus, horrified at his [[patricide]] and [[incest]], proceeds to gouge out his own eyes in despair.

''Oedipus Rex'' is regarded by many scholars as the masterpiece of ancient Greek tragedy. In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] refers several times to the play in order to exemplify aspects of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristotle: Poetics''. Edited and translated by St. Halliwell, (Loeb Classical Library), Harvard 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Elizabeth|last=Belfiore|title=Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion|location=Princeton|year=1992|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
[[File:Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres - Oedipus and the Sphinx - Walters 379.jpg|left|thumb|Painting by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] depicting Oedipus after he solves the riddle of the Sphinx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[The Walters Art Museum]]|url=http://art.thewalters.org/detail/7916|title=Oedipus and the Sphinx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum.]]
Many parts or elements of the myth of Oedipus occur before the opening scene of the play, although some are alluded to in the text.  Oedipus is the son of [[Laius]] and [[Jocasta]], the king and queen of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]].  The misfortunes of his house are the result of a curse laid upon his father for violating the sacred laws of hospitality.  In his youth, Laius was the guest of [[Pelops]], the king of [[Elis]], and he became the tutor of [[Chrysippus (mythology)|Chrysippus]], the king's youngest son, in [[chariot racing]].  Laius seduced or abducted and raped Chrysippus, who according to some versions, killed himself in shame.  This murder cast a doom over Laius and all of his descendants (although many scholars regard Laius' transgressions against Chrysippus to be a late addition to the myth).

When his son is born, the king consults an [[oracle]] as to his fortune.  To his horror, the oracle reveals that Laius &quot;is doomed to perish by the hand of his own son&quot;.   Laius binds the infant's feet together with a pin, and orders Jocasta to kill him.  Unable to kill her own son, Jocasta orders a servant to slay the infant for her.  The servant then exposes the infant on a mountaintop, where he is found and rescued by a shepherd (in some versions, the servant gives the infant to the shepherd).  The shepherd names the child [[Oedipus]], &quot;swollen feet&quot;, as his feet had been tightly bound by Laius.  The shepherd brings the infant to [[Corinth]], and presents him to the childless king [[Polybus of Corinth|Polybus]], who raises Oedipus as his own son.

As he grows to manhood, Oedipus hears a rumour that he is not truly the son of Polybus and his wife, [[Merope (Oedipus)|Merope]]. He asks the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] who his parents really are. The Oracle seems to ignore this question, telling him instead that he is destined to &quot;''mate with [his] own mother, and shed/With [his] own hands the blood of [his] own sire''&quot;.  Desperate to avoid this terrible fate, Oedipus, who still believes that Polybus and Merope are his true parents, leaves Corinth for the city of Thebes.

On the road to Thebes, Oedipus encounters Laius and his retainers, and the two quarrel over whose chariot has the right of way.  The Theban king moves to strike the insolent youth with his sceptre, but Oedipus, unaware that Laius is his true father, throws the old man down from his chariot, killing him.  Thus, Laius is slain by his own son, and the prophecy that the king had sought to avoid by exposing Oedipus at birth is fulfilled.

Before arriving at Thebes, Oedipus encounters the [[Sphinx]], a legendary beast with the head and breast of a woman, the body of a lioness, and the wings of an eagle.  The Sphinx was sent to the road approaching Thebes as a punishment from the gods, and would strangle any traveler who failed to answer [[riddle of the Sphinx|a certain riddle]].  The precise riddle asked by the Sphinx varied in early traditions, and is not stated in ''Oedipus Rex'', as the event precedes the play; but the most widely-known version is, &quot;''what is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three in the evening?''&quot;  Oedipus correctly guesses, &quot;''man''&quot;, who crawls on all fours as an infant, walks upright in maturity, and leans on a stick in old age.  Bested by the prince, the Sphinx throws herself from a cliff, thereby ending the curse.&lt;ref&gt;Ahl, Frederick. ''Two Faces of Oedipus: Sophocles' Oedipus Tyrannus and Seneca's Oedipus''. Cornell University Press, 2008. page 1. {{ISBN|9780801473975}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Oedipus' reward for freeing Thebes from the Sphinx is its kingship, and the hand of the [[Queen dowager|dowager queen]], Jocasta; none then realize that Jocasta is Oedipus' true mother.&lt;ref&gt;[https://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/sophocles/oedipustheking.htm Johnston, Ian. &quot;Background Notes&quot;, Vancouver Island University]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, unknown to all of the characters, the prophecy has been fulfilled.

==Plot==
[[File:Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 1369 - Bridwell Papyrus 4 - Sophocles, Oedipus the King - recto.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri|P. Oxy.]] 1369, a fragmentary papyrus copy of ''Oedipus Rex'', 4th century BC.]]
Oedipus, King of Thebes, sends his brother-in-law, Creon, to ask advice of the oracle at [[Pythia|Delphi]], concerning a plague ravaging Thebes. Creon returns to report that the plague is the result of religious pollution, since the murderer of their former king, [[Laius]], has never been caught. Oedipus vows to find the murderer and curses him for causing the plague.

Oedipus summons the blind prophet [[Tiresias]] for help. When Tiresias arrives he claims to know the answers to Oedipus's questions, but refuses to speak, instead telling him to abandon his search. Oedipus is enraged by Tiresias' refusal, and verbally accuses him of complicity in Laius' murder. Outraged, Tiresias tells the king that Oedipus himself is the murderer (&quot;You yourself are the criminal you seek&quot;). Oedipus cannot see how this could be, and concludes that the prophet must have been paid off by Creon in an attempt to undermine him. The two argue vehemently, as Oedipus mocks Tiresias' lack of sight, and Tiresias in turn tells Oedipus that he himself is blind. Eventually Tiresias leaves, muttering darkly that when the murderer is discovered he shall be a native citizen of Thebes, brother and father to his own children, and son and husband to his own mother.

Creon arrives to face Oedipus's accusations. The King demands that Creon be executed; however, the [[Greek Chorus|chorus]] persuades him to let Creon live. [[Jocasta]] enters and attempts to comfort Oedipus, telling him he should take no notice of prophets. As proof, she recounts an incident in which she and Laius received an [[oracle]] which never came true. The prophecy stated that Laius would be killed by his own son; however, Jocasta reassures Oedipus by her statement that Laius was killed by bandits at a [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] on the way to [[Delphi]].

The mention of this crossroads causes Oedipus to pause and ask for more details. He asks Jocasta what Laius looked like, and Oedipus suddenly becomes worried that Tiresias's accusations were true. Oedipus then sends for the one surviving witness of the attack to be brought to the palace from the fields where he now works as a shepherd.

Jocasta, confused, asks Oedipus what the matter is, and he tells her. Many years ago, at a banquet in Corinth, a man drunkenly accused Oedipus of not being his father's son. Oedipus went to Delphi and asked the oracle about his parentage. Instead of answers he was given a prophecy that he would one day murder his father and sleep with his mother. Upon hearing this he resolved to leave Corinth and never return. While traveling he came to the very crossroads where Laius was killed, and encountered a carriage which attempted to drive him off the road. An argument ensued and Oedipus killed the travelers, including a man who matches Jocasta's description of Laius. Oedipus has hope, however, because the story is that Laius was murdered by ''several'' robbers. If the shepherd confirms that Laius was attacked by many men, then Oedipus is in the clear.

A man arrives from [[Corinth]] with the message that Oedipus's [[Polybus of Corinth|father]] has died. Oedipus, to the surprise of the messenger, is made ecstatic by this news, for it proves one half of the prophecy false, for now he can never kill his father. However, he still fears that he may somehow commit incest with his mother. The messenger, eager to ease Oedipus's mind, tells him not to worry, because Merope was not in fact his real mother.

It emerges that this messenger was formerly a shepherd on [[Cithaeron|Mount Cithaeron]], and that he was given a baby, which the childless [[Polybus of Corinth|Polybus]] then adopted. The baby, he says, was given to him by another shepherd from the Laius household, who had been told to get rid of the child. Oedipus asks the chorus if anyone knows who this man was, or where he might be now. They respond that he is the ''same shepherd'' who was witness to the murder of Laius, and whom Oedipus had already sent for. Jocasta, who has by now realized the truth, desperately begs Oedipus to stop asking questions, but he refuses and Jocasta runs into the palace.

When the shepherd arrives Oedipus questions him, but he begs to be allowed to leave without answering further. However, Oedipus presses him, finally threatening him with torture or execution. It emerges that the child he gave away was Laius's own son, and that Jocasta had given the baby to the shepherd to secretly be [[infanticide|exposed]] upon the mountainside. This was done in fear of the prophecy that Jocasta said had never come true: that the child would kill his father.

Everything is at last revealed, and Oedipus curses himself and fate before leaving the stage. The chorus laments how even a great man can be felled by fate, and following this, a servant exits the palace to speak of what has happened inside. When Jocasta enters the house, she runs to the palace bedroom and hangs herself there. Shortly afterward, Oedipus enters in a fury, calling on his servants to bring him a sword so that he might cut out his mother's womb. He then rages through the house, until he comes upon Jocasta's body. Giving a cry, Oedipus takes her down and removes the long gold pins that held her dress together, before plunging them into his own eyes in despair.

A blind Oedipus now exits the palace and begs to be [[exile]]d as soon as possible. Creon enters, saying that Oedipus shall be taken into the house until oracles can be consulted regarding what is best to be done. Oedipus's two daughters (and half-sisters), [[Antigone]] and [[Ismene]], are sent out, and Oedipus laments their having been born to such a cursed family. He asks Creon to watch over them and Creon agrees, before sending Oedipus back into the palace.

On an empty stage the chorus repeat the common Greek [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]], that no man should be considered fortunate until he is dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], in his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' (Book 1.32), attributes this maxim to the 6th-century [[Athens|Athenian]] statesman [[Solon]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with mythic tradition==
The two cities of [[Troy]] and [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] were the major focus of Greek [[epic poetry]]. The events surrounding the [[Trojan War]] were chronicled in the [[Epic Cycle]], of which much remains, and those about Thebes in the [[Theban Cycle]], which have been lost. The Theban Cycle recounted the sequence of tragedies that befell the house of [[Laius]], of which the story of Oedipus is a part.

[[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' (XI.271ff.) contains the earliest account of the Oedipus myth when [[Odysseus]] encounters Jocasta (named Epicaste) in the [[underworld]]. Homer briefly summarises the story of Oedipus, including the incest, patricide, and Jocasta's subsequent suicide. However, in the Homeric version, Oedipus remains King of Thebes after the revelation and neither blinds himself, nor is sent into exile. In particular, it is said that the gods made the matter of his paternity known, whilst in ''Oedipus the King'', Oedipus very much discovers the truth himself.&lt;ref&gt;Dawe, R.D. ed. 2006 ''Sophocles:'' Oedipus Rex'', revised edition.'' Cambridge : Cambridge University Press. p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 467 BC, Sophocles's fellow tragedian [[Aeschylus]] won first prize at the [[City Dionysia]] with a trilogy about the House of Laius, comprising ''Laius'', ''Oedipus'' and ''[[Seven against Thebes]]'' (the only play which survives). Since he did not write connected trilogies as Aeschylus did, ''Oedipus Rex'' focuses on the titular character while hinting at the larger myth obliquely, which was already known to the audience in Athens at the time.

==Reception==
[[File:Bénigne Gagneraux, The Blind Oedipus Commending his Children to the Gods.jpg|thumb|Bénigne Gagneraux, ''The Blind Oedipus Commending his Children to the Gods'']]
The trilogy containing ''Oedipus Rex'' took second prize in the [[City Dionysia]] at its original performance. Aeschylus's nephew [[Philocles]] took first prize at that competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Helaine|year=2005|title=Masterpieces of Classic Greek Drama |page=1|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-33268-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] considered ''Oedipus Rex'' to be the tragedy which best matched his prescription for how drama should be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oedipus Rex: Literary Touchstone Edition|author1=Thomas, J.E.  |author2=Osborne, E. |lastauthoramp=yes |page=69|publisher=Prestwick House Inc.|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58049-593-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern critics agree with Aristotle on the quality of ''Oedipus Rex'', even if they don't always agree on the reasons. For example, [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb]] claimed that &quot;The ''Oedipus Tyrannus'' is in one sense the masterpiece of Attic tragedy. No other shows an equal degree of art in the development of the plot; and this excellence depends on the powerful and subtle drawing of the characters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oedipus Tyrannus|author=Jebb, R.C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ofi9Ipq3YNMC&amp;pg=PR18&amp;dq=jebb+oedipus+rex+commentary&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=v|isbn=978-1-4460-3178-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cedric Whitman]] noted that &quot;the ''Oedipus Rex'' passes almost universally for the greatest extant Greek play...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sophocles|author=Whitman, C.|page=123|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman himself regarded the play as &quot;the fullest expression of this conception of tragedy,&quot; that is the conception of tragedy as a &quot;revelation of the evil lot of man,&quot; where a man may have &quot;all the equipment for glory and honor&quot; but still have &quot;the greatest effort to do good&quot; end in &quot;the evil of an unbearable self for which one is not responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sophocles|author=Whitman, C.|page=143|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edith Hall referred to ''Oedipus the King'' as &quot;this definitive tragedy&quot; and notes that &quot;the magisterial subtlety of Sophocles' characterization thus lend credibility to the breathtaking coincidences,&quot; and notes the irony that &quot;Oedipus can only fulfill his exceptional god-ordained destiny because Oedipus is a preeminently capable and intelligent human being.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sophocles: Antigone, Oedipus the King, Electra|author=Hall, E.|pages=xix-xxii|chapter=Introduction|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-282922-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. D. F. Kitto]] said about ''Oedipus Rex'' that &quot;it is true to say that the perfection of its form implies a world order,&quot; although Kitto notes that whether or not that world order &quot;is beneficent, Sophocles does not say.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Greek Tragedy|author=Kitto, H.D.F|page=144|year=1966|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-05896-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The science revolution attributed to [[Thales]] began gaining political force, and this play offered a warning to the new thinkers. Kitto interprets the play as Sophocles' retort to the [[sophist]]s, by dramatizing a situation in which humans face undeserved suffering through no fault of their own, but despite the apparent randomness of the events, the fact that they have been prophesied by the gods implies that the events are not random, despite the reasons being beyond human comprehension.&lt;ref name=poiesis&gt;{{cite book|title=Poiesis|author=Kitto, H.D.F|pages=236–242|year=1966|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the play, according to Kitto, Sophocles declares &quot;that it is wrong, in the face of the incomprehensible and unmoral, to deny the moral laws and accept chaos. What is right is to recognize facts and not delude ourselves. The universe is a unity; if, sometimes, we can see neither rhyme nor reason in it we should not suppose it is random. There is so much that we cannot know and cannot control that we should not think and behave as if we do know and can control.&lt;ref name=poiesis/&gt;

==Themes and motifs==

===Fate, free will, or tragic flaw===
Fate is a theme that often occurs in Greek writing, tragedies in particular. The idea that attempting to avoid an oracle is the very thing which brings it about is a common motif in many Greek myths, and similarities to Oedipus can for example be seen in the myth of the birth of [[Perseus]].

Two oracles in particular dominate the plot of ''Oedipus Rex''. In lines 711 to 714, Jocasta relates the prophecy that was told to [[Laius]] before the birth of Oedipus. Namely:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''(The oracle) told him''&lt;br /&gt;
''that it was his fate that he should die a victim''&lt;br /&gt;
''at the hands of his own son, a son to be born''&lt;br /&gt;
''of Laius and me.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The oracle told to Laius tells only of the [[patricide]]; the [[incest]] is missing. Prompted by Jocasta's recollection, Oedipus reveals the prophecy which caused him to leave [[Corinth]] (791-93):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''that I was fated to lie with my mother,''&lt;br /&gt;
''and show to daylight an accursed breed''&lt;br /&gt;
''which men would not endure, and I was doomed''&lt;br /&gt;
''to be murderer of the father that begot me.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The implication of Laius's oracle is ambiguous. One interpretation considers that the presentation of Laius's oracle in this play differs from that found in [[Aeschylus]]'s Oedipus trilogy produced in 467 BC. Helaine Smith argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sophocles had the option of making the oracle to Laius conditional (''if'' Laius has a son, that son will kill him) or unconditional (Laius ''will'' have a son who will kill him). Both Aeschylus and Euripides write plays in which the oracle is conditional; Sophocles ... chooses to make Laius's oracle unconditional and thus removes culpability for his sins
from Oedipus, for he could not have done other than what he did, no matter what action he took.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Helaine|year=2005|title=Masterpieces of Classic Greek Drama |page=82|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-33268-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Dodds 1966; Mastronarde 1994, 19; Gregory 2005, 323.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This interpretation is supported by Jocasta's repetition of the oracle at lines 854–55: &quot;Loxias declared that the king should be killed by/ his own son.&quot; In the Greek, Jocasta uses the verb ''chrênai'': &quot;to be fated, necessary.&quot; This iteration of the oracle seems to suggest that it was unconditional and inevitable. Other scholars have nonetheless argued that Sophocles follows tradition in making Laius's oracle conditional, and thus avoidable. They point to Jocasta's initial disclosure of the oracle at lines 711–14. In the Greek, the oracle cautions: ''hôs auton '''hexoi''' moira pros paidos thanein''/ ''hostis '''genoit''''' ''emou te kakeinou para''. The two verbs in boldface indicate what is called a &quot;future more vivid&quot; condition: ''if'' a child is born to Laius, his fate to be killed by that child ''will'' overtake him.&lt;ref&gt;Thus Sir Richard Jebb in his [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0016%3Acommline%3D714 commentary]. Cf. Jeffrey Rusten's 1990 commentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the meaning of Laius's oracle, the one delivered to Oedipus is clearly unconditional. Given our modern conception of [[destiny|fate]] and [[fatalism]], readers of the play have a tendency to view Oedipus as a mere puppet controlled by greater forces, a man crushed by the gods and fate for no good reason. This, however, is not an entirely accurate reading. While it is a mythological truism that oracles exist to be fulfilled, oracles do not cause the events that lead up to the outcome. In his landmark essay &quot;On Misunderstanding the ''Oedipus Rex''&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Greece &amp; Rome'', 2nd Ser., Vol. 13, No. 1 (Apr., 1966), pp. 37–49&lt;/ref&gt; [[E.R. Dodds]] draws a comparison with [[Jesus]]'s prophecy at the [[Last Supper]] that [[Saint Peter|Peter]] would deny him three times. Jesus ''knows'' that Peter will do this, but readers would in no way suggest that Peter was a puppet of fate being ''forced'' to deny Christ. [[Free will]] and [[predestination]] are by no means mutually exclusive, and such is the case with Oedipus.

The oracle delivered to Oedipus what is often called a &quot;[[self-fulfilling prophecy]]&quot;, in that the prophecy itself sets in motion events that conclude with its own fulfilment.&lt;ref&gt;Strictly speaking, this is inaccurate: Oedipus himself sets these events in motion when he decides to investigate his parentage against the advice of Polybus and Merope.&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, is not to say that Oedipus is a victim of fate and has no free will. The oracle inspires a series of specific choices, freely made by Oedipus, which lead him to kill his father and marry his mother. Oedipus ''chooses'' not to return to Corinth after hearing the oracle, just as he chooses to head toward Thebes, to kill Laius, to marry and to take Jocasta specifically as his bride; in response to the plague at Thebes, he ''chooses'' to send Creon to the Oracle for advice and then to follow that advice, initiating the investigation into Laius's murder. None of these choices are predetermined.

[[File:The Plague of Thebes.jpg|thumb|left|''Oedipus and Antigone'', by [[Charles Jalabert]].]]
Another characteristic of oracles in myth is that they are almost always misunderstood by those who hear them; hence Oedipus's misunderstanding the significance of the Delphic Oracle. He visits Delphi to find out who his real parents are and assumes that the Oracle refuses to answer that question, offering instead an unrelated prophecy which forecasts patricide and incest. Oedipus's assumption is incorrect, the Oracle does, in a way, answer his question:

&quot;On closer analysis the oracle contains essential information which Oedipus seems to neglect.&quot; The wording of the Oracle: I was doomed to be murderer of the father that begot me refers to Oedipus' real, biological father. Likewise the mother with polluted children is defined as the biological one. The wording of the drunken guest on the other hand: you are not your father's son defines Polybus as only a foster father to Oedipus. The two wordings support each other and point to the &quot;two set of parents&quot; alternative. Thus the question of two set of parents, biological and foster, is raised. Oedipus's reaction to the Oracle is irrational: he states he did not get any answer and he flees in a direction away from Corinth, showing that he firmly believed at the time that Polybus and Merope are his real parents.

&quot;The scene with the drunken guest constitutes the end of Oedipus' childhood.  … he can no longer ignore a feeling of uncertainty about his parentage. However, after consulting the Oracle this uncertainty disappears, strangely enough, and is replaced by a totally unjustified certainty that he is the son of Merope and Polybus. We have said that this irrational behaviour - his hamartia in Aristotle's sense - is due to the repression of a whole series of thoughts in his consciousness, in fact everything that referred to his earlier doubts about his parentage.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner M. &quot;King Oedipus Retried&quot; Rosenberger &amp; Krausz, London, 2001. {{ISBN|0-9536219-1-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State control===
The exploration of this theme in ''Oedipus Rex'' is paralleled by the examination of the conflict between the individual and the [[State (polity)|state]] in ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''. The dilemma that Oedipus faces here is similar to that of the tyrannical Creon: each man has, as king, made a decision that his subjects question or disobey; each king also misconstrues both his own role as a sovereign and the role of the rebel. When informed by the blind prophet [[Tiresias]] that religious forces are against him, each king claims that the priest has been corrupted. It is here, however, that their similarities come to an end: while Creon, seeing the havoc he has wreaked, tries to amend his mistakes, Oedipus refuses to listen to anyone.&lt;ref&gt;Sophocles. Sophocles I: Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus, Antigone. 2nd ed. Grene, David and Lattimore, Richard, eds. Chicago: University of Chicago, 1991.{{clarify|date=December 2007}}&lt;!-- Is this the editors' interpretation, or is this volume being cited for the play? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sight and blindness===
Literal and metaphorical references to eyesight appear throughout ''Oedipus Rex''. Clear vision serves as a metaphor for insight and knowledge, but the clear-eyed Oedipus is blind to the truth about his origins and inadvertent crimes. The prophet [[Tiresias]], on the other hand, although literally blind, &quot;sees&quot; the truth and relays what is revealed to him. &quot;Though Oedipus' future is predicted by the gods, even after being warned by Tiresias, he ''cannot'' see the truth or reality beforehand because his excessive pride has blinded his vision…&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ijalel&quot;&gt;Ziaul Haque, Md. &amp; Kabir Chowdhury, Fahmida. &quot;The Concept of Blindness in Sophocles' ''King Oedipus'' and Arthur Miller's ''Death of a Salesman''&quot;, {{cite web |url=http://www.ijalel.org/view.aspx?articleid=269 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525214338/http://www.ijalel.org/view.aspx?articleid=269 |archivedate=2014-05-25 |df= }}, ''International Journal of Applied Linguistics &amp; English Literature'', vol. 2, no. 3; 2013, p. 118, Retrieved on April 01, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Only after Oedipus has physically blinded himself does he gain a limited prophetic ability, as seen in ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]''. It is deliberately ironic that the &quot;seer&quot; can &quot;see&quot; better than Oedipus, despite being blind. In one line (Oedipus the king, 469), Tiresias says:

''&quot;So, you mock my blindness? Let me tell you this. You [Oedipus] with your precious eyes, you're blind to the corruption of your life ...&quot;'' (Robert Fagles 1984)

==Sigmund Freud==
[[File:Oedipus &amp; Sphinx.jpg|thumb|A Greek amphora depicting Oedipus and the Sphinx, ''circa'' 450 BC.]]
[[Sigmund Freud]] in ''[[Interpretation of Dreams]]'' wrote a notable passage regarding of the destiny of Oedipus as well as the [[Oedipus complex]]. He analyzes why this play, ''Oedipus Rex'', written in Ancient Greece, is so effective even to a modern audience.  Freud says,

&lt;blockquote&gt;His destiny moves us only because it might have been ours — because the oracle laid the same curse upon us before our birth as upon him.  It is the fate of all of us, perhaps, to direct our first sexual impulse towards our mother and our first hatred and our first murderous wish against our father.  Our dreams convince us that this is so.”&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. ''The Interpretation of Dreams''. Basic Books. 978-0465019779 (2010) page 279-280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same book, Freud indicates, however, that the  “primordial urges and fears” that are his concern are not found primarily in the play by Sophocles, but exist in the myth the play is based on; he refers to the play as a “further modification of the legend”, one that originates in a “misconceived secondary revision of the material, which has sought to exploit it for theological purposes.”&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. ''The Interpretation of Dreams''. Basic Books. 978-0465019779 (2010) page 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fagles, Robert, “Introduction”. Sophocles. ''The Three Theban Plays''. Penguin Classics (1984)  {{ISBN|978-0140444254}}. page 132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dodds, E. R. “On Misunderstanding the Oedipus Rex”. ''The Ancient Concept of Progress.'' Oxford Press. (1973) {{ISBN|978-0198143772}}. page 70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
===Film versions===
The play has been filmed several times, twice in English.

The [[Oedipus Rex (1957 film)|1957 film]] version, directed by [[Tyrone Guthrie]], starred [[Douglas Campbell (actor)|Douglas Campbell]] as Oedipus and had the cast performing the entire play in masks, as in ancient Greek theatre.

The [[Oedipus the King (1968 film)|second English language film version]], directed by [[Philip Saville]] and released in 1968, was filmed in Greece. This one showed the actors' faces and boasted an all-star cast, including [[Christopher Plummer]] as Oedipus, [[Lilli Palmer]] as Jocasta, [[Orson Welles]] as Tiresias, [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]] as Creon, [[Roger Livesey]] as the Shepherd, and [[Donald Sutherland]] as the Leading Member of the Chorus. Sutherland's voice, however, was dubbed by another actor. The film went a step further than the play, however, by actually showing, in flashback, the murder of Laius ([[Friedrich Ledebur]]). It also showed Oedipus and Jocasta in bed together, making love. Made in 1968, this film was not seen in Europe and the U.S. until the 1970s and 1980s after legal release and distribution rights were granted to video and TV.

In 1967 [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] directed ''[[Oedipus Rex (1967 film)|Edipo Re]]'', a modern interpretation of the play. [[Toshio Matsumoto]]'s 1969 film, ''[[Funeral Parade of Roses]]'', is a loose adaptation of the play and an important work of the [[Japanese New Wave]]. In [[Colombia]], writer [[Gabriel García Márquez]] adapted the story in ''[[Edipo Alcalde]]'', bringing it to the real Colombian situation.

===TV/Radio versions===
[[Michael Pennington]] starred as Oedipus with [[Claire Bloom]] as Jocasta, [[Sir John Gielgud]] as Tiresias and [[John Shrapnel]] as Creon in [[Don Taylor (English director and playwright)|Don Taylor]]'s 1986 translation/adaptation of the play, which formed part of the BBC's ''The Theban Plays'' trilogy.

In 1977, [[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]] broadcast a version of the story called &quot;So Shall Ye Reap&quot;, set in what was then the US Territory of New Mexico in 1851.

Other television Oedipus's include Christopher Plummer (1957), [[Ian Holm]] (1972) and [[Patrick Stewart]] (1977).

In 2017, [[BBC Radio 3]] broadcast a production of [[Anthony Burgess]]' translation of the play with [[Christopher Eccleston]] as Oedipus and [[Fiona Shaw]] as Tiresias/Second Elder. John Shrapnel, who starred as Creon in the 1986 BBC television version, played The First Elder.

===Parodies===
[[Chrysanthos Mentis Bostantzoglou]] makes a parody of this tragedy in his comedy ''Medea'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;Kaggelaris, N. (2016), &quot;Sophocles' Oedipus in Mentis Bostantzoglou's ''Medea''&quot; [in Greek] in Mastrapas, A. N. - Stergioulis, M. M. (eds.) '' Seminar 42: Sophocles the great classic of tragedy '', Athens: Koralli, pp. 74- 81 [https://www.academia.edu/30141685/%CE%9F_%CE%9F%CE%B9%CE%B4%CE%AF%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%82_%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85_%CE%A3%CE%BF%CF%86%CE%BF%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%AE_%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7_%CE%9C%CE%AE%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%B1_%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85_%CE%9C%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%84_Sophocles_Oedipus_in_Mentis_Bostantzoglous_Medea_.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In episode ten of the second season of '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''[[CNNNN]]''', an Australian satirical television program made by [[The Chaser]], a short animation in the style of a Disney movie trailer, complete with jaunty music provided by [[Andrew Hansen]], parodies ''Oedipus Rex''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Chaser Archive|title=CNNNN - Season 2 Episode 10|date=2011-10-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrjgw2HSFI8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m50s|accessdate=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from being advertised as &quot;Fun for the whole family&quot;, the parody is also mentioned at other times during that same episode, such as in a satirical advertisement in which orphans are offered a free &quot;''Oedipus Rex'' ashes urn&quot; as a promotional offer after losing a relative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Chaser Archive|title=CNNNN - Season 2 Episode 10|date=2011-10-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrjgw2HSFI8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=16m32s|accessdate=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''How to Train Your Dragon 2''''' is a 2014 American [[3D film|3D]] [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] [[fantasy film|fantasy]] [[action film]] produced by [[DreamWorks Animation]] and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]], loosely based on the British [[How to Train Your Dragon|book series of the same name]] by [[Cressida Cowell]]. It is the sequel to the 2010 computer-animated film ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'' and the second in the [[How to Train Your Dragon (franchise)|trilogy]]. The film is written and directed by [[Dean DeBlois]], and stars the voices of [[Jay Baruchel]], [[Gerard Butler]], [[Craig Ferguson]], [[America Ferrera]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]], [[T.J. Miller]], and [[Kristen Wiig]], with the addition of [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], and [[Kit Harington]]. The film takes place five years after the first film, featuring Hiccup and his friends as young adults as they meet Valka, Hiccup's long-lost mother, and Drago Bludvist, a madman who wants to conquer the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giardina|first1=Carolyn|title=Annie Awards: 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' Director on Toothless' Storyline in Next Film|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/annie-awards-how-train-your-768932|accessdate=March 1, 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeBlois, who co-directed the first film, agreed to return to direct the second film on the condition that he would be allowed to turn it into a trilogy. He cited ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' and ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' as his main inspirations, with the expanded scope of ''The Empire Strikes Back'' being particularly influential. The entire voice cast from the first film returned, and Cate Blanchett and Djimon Hounsou signed on to voice Valka and Drago, respectively. DeBlois and his creative team visited [[Norway]] and [[Svalbard]] to give them ideas for the setting. Composer [[John Powell (composer)|John Powell]] returned to score the film. ''How to Train Your Dragon 2'' benefited from advances in animation technology and was DreamWorks' first film to use scalable multicore processing and the studio's new animation and lighting software.

The film was released on June 13, 2014, and like its predecessor, received wide acclaim. Critics praised the film for its animation, voice acting, action scenes, musical score, emotional depth, and darker, more serious tone compared to its predecessor. It received the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]. The film won six [[Annie Award]]s, including [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] and Best Director. The film grossed over $621 million worldwide, making it the 12th-highest-grossing film of 2014. It earned less than its predecessor at the US box office, but performed better internationally. A third installment in the trilogy, ''[[How to Train Your Dragon 3]]'', is scheduled to be released on March 1, 2019.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Plot sections must describe the story in your own words. Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], the plot summary should be 400 to 700 words. Also, please don't change any of the paragraphs. Thank you. --&gt;
Five years after the [[Vikings|Viking]] village of Berk and the dragons made peace, they now live together in harmony. Hiccup goes on adventures with his dragon, Toothless, as they discover and map unexplored lands. Now 20 years old, he is being pressed by his father, Stoick the Vast, to succeed him as chieftain, although Hiccup remains unsure if he is ready for this responsibility.

While investigating a burnt forest, Hiccup and Astrid discover the remains of a fort encased in ice and meet a group of dragon trappers led by Eret, who blames them for his fort's destruction and attempts to capture their dragons for an insane conqueror named Drago Bludvist. The two dragon riders escape and return to Berk to warn Stoick about the dragon army that Drago is amassing. Stoick orders the villagers to fortify the island and prepare for battle. Hiccup, however, refuses to believe that war is inevitable. After Stoick interrupts Hiccup's plan to get Eret to take him to Drago, Stoick explains that he once met Drago at a gathering of chiefs, where Drago, mocked after offering the chiefs his service in return for their servitude, murdered them all using armored dragons, with Stoick as the only survivor. Undeterred, Hiccup flies off with Toothless in search of Drago to try to reason with him.

They run into a dragon rider named Valka, who is revealed to be Hiccup's long-lost mother. She explains that she, like her son, could not bring herself to kill dragons. After being carried off during a dragon raid, she spent 20 years rescuing dragons from Drago's traps and bringing them to an island nest created out of ice by a gigantic [[Alpha (ethology)|Alpha]] dragon called a &quot;Bewilderbeast&quot;, which is able to control smaller dragons. Stoick tracks Hiccup to the nest, where he discovers that his wife is still alive. Meanwhile, Astrid and the other riders kidnap Eret to find Drago, but Drago captures them and learns of Berk's dragons.

Drago and his armada lay siege to the nest, where he reveals that he has his own Bewilderbeast to challenge the Alpha. A battle ensues between the two colossal dragons, which ends with Drago's Bewilderbeast killing its opponent and becoming the new Alpha. Drago's Bewilderbeast then seizes control of all the adult dragons, which hypnotically obey. Hiccup tries to persuade Drago to end the violence, but Drago orders him killed. Toothless, under the Bewilderbeast's influence, approaches Hiccup and launches a blast, but Stoick pushes Hiccup out of the way and is hit instead, dying as a result. The Bewilderbeast momentarily relinquishes control of Toothless, but Hiccup drives him away in a fit of despair. Drago maroons Hiccup and the others on the island and rides Toothless, again under the control of the Bewilderbeast, to lead his army to conquer Berk. Stoick is given a [[Norse funeral|Viking funeral]] and Hiccup, now having lost both his father and dragon, is unsure what to do. Valka encourages him by telling him that he alone can unite humans and dragons, and inspired by her words and his father's, Hiccup decides to return to Berk to stop Drago.

The dragon riders fly baby dragons back to Berk, as they are immune to the Bewilderbeast's control. They find that Drago has already attacked the village and taken control of its dragons. Hiccup confronts Drago and a brainwashed Toothless while the other riders work to distract the Bewilderbeast. Hiccup succeeds in freeing Toothless from the Bewilderbeast's control, much to Drago's surprise. Hiccup and Toothless briefly separate Drago from the Bewilderbeast and confront Drago on the ground, but the Bewilderbeast attacks them, encasing them in ice. However, Toothless blasts away the ice, revealing that both Hiccup and he are unharmed. He then challenges the Bewilderbeast, shooting it in the face repeatedly, which breaks its control over the other dragons, who side with Toothless as the new Alpha dragon. All the dragons repeatedly fire at the Bewilderbeast until Toothless fires a final massive blast, breaking its left tusk. Defeated, the Bewilderbeast retreats under the sea with Drago on its back. The Vikings and dragons celebrate their victory and Hiccup is made chieftain of Berk.

Afterwards, Berk undergoes repairs while feeling secure knowing that its dragons can defend it.

While the first film was set in a generic [[North Sea]] environment, the creative team decided to focus on Norway this time around.

At the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]], Peter Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the film and its ambitions: &quot;The pressures to make a giant four-quadrant monstrosity must be enormous, and yet, like his unflappable hero Hiccup, ''How to Train Your Dragon 2'' writer-director Dean DeBlois has prevailed, serving up DreamWorks Animation's strongest sequel yet—one that breathes fresh fire into the franchise, instead of merely rehashing the original. Braver than ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'', more fun than ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', and more emotionally satisfying than so many of its live-action counterparts, ''Dragon'' delivers. And good thing, too, since DWA desperately needs another toon to cross the half-billion-dollar threshold.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Debruge |first= Peter |title= Cannes Film Review: 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' |url= https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/cannes-film-review-how-to-train-your-dragon-2-1201181707/ |work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate= May 16, 2014 |date= May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Weitzman of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' gave the film three out of five stars, saying 'It's the unflinching edge that gives the film its unexpected depth'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/train-dragon-2-movie-review-article-1.1825764 |title='How to Train Your Dragon 2,' movie review |publisher=NY Daily News |date= June 12, 2014|accessdate=June 13, 2014 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jocelyn Noveck of the [[Associated Press]] gave the film three out of four stars, saying &quot;''How to Train Your Dragon 2'' doesn't play it safe, and that's why it's the rare sequel that doesn't feel somewhat stale.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Jocelyn Noveck | agency = Associated Press | url = http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/movies/20140610_ap_e56d9fd1b22347ac9e4e00b7e04550ee.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20140613211643/http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/movies/20140610_ap_e56d9fd1b22347ac9e4e00b7e04550ee.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = June 13, 2014 | title = Review: Lovely visuals, smart writing in 'Dragon' | publisher = Philly.com | date = October 22, 2012 | accessdate = June 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lou Lumenick]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, saying &quot;''Dragon 2'' really soars when our hero is aloft, imparting some important lessons about family, ecology and war for young audiences.

&lt;!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, this section should be 400-700 words.--&gt;
{{Hatnote|The plot of the film connects with the predecessor. For more information on the predecessor's plot, see [[Baahubali: The Beginning#Plot|Baahubali: The Beginning]].}}

Kattappa continues to narrate how he ended up killing Amarendra Baahubali.
After vanquishing the Kalakeyas, Amarendra Baahubali is declared as the future king of [[Mahishmati]] and [[Bhallaladeva]] its commander-in-chief. The Rajamata Sivagami orders Amarendra to tour the kingdom and its neighbourhood, along with Kattappa. During the tour, Amarendra witnesses an attack by Devasena, the princess of Kuntala, a kingdom neighbouring Mahishmati. Falling in love with her, he approaches her after the fight, posing as a simpleton, and is accepted into the royal palace for a job.

Bhallaladeva receives message of Amarendra's act and upon viewing Devasena's portrait, lusts for her. He asks Sivagami for Devasena's hand in marriage. The Rajamata, who was unaware of Amarendra's feelings for Devasena, assures Bhallaladeva and sends an emissary to Kuntala, who delivers the marriage proposal in a patronising way. An insulted Devasena rejects the proposal with a scathing reply. Enraged hearing her response, Sivagami sends an order to Amarendra that Devasena be brought to Mahishmati as a captive.

Meanwhile, Kuntala is attacked by Pindaris, a [[Dacoity|dacoit]]-like army. Amarendra, with the help of Devasena's maternal cousin, Kumara Varma, is able to nullify the attack and save Kuntala. Upon being questioned, Amarendra reveals his true identity. He receives a bird post from Mahishmati, ordering him to take Devasena as captive. He promises Devasena that he will protect her honour and convinces her to come with him to Mahishmati as his future bride.

Upon reaching Mahishmati, the misunderstanding is brought to light and when an ultimatum is delivered to Amarendra that he must either choose the throne or Devasena, he chooses the latter. Bhallaladeva is crowned king and Amarendra is made the new commander-in-chief. During Devasena's baby shower, Bhallaladeva rids Amarendra of his duties as a &quot;gift&quot;. Devasena speaks out against Sivagami's inaction and taunts Bhallaladeva. Due to further clashes, Amarendra and Devasena are banished from the royal palace, living happily among the people.

Bijjaladeva convinces Kumara Varma that Bhallaladeva is after Amarendra's life and he must kill the king to safeguard his brother-in-law. Kumara Varma enters the palace in the stealth of the night, only to be discovered by Bhallaladeva and be killed, but not before revealing their plot to convince Sivagami to kill Amarendra. Sivagami, convinced that Bhallaladeva's life is under threat but that open hostility would result in civil war, orders Kattappa to assassinate Amarendra. Kattappa, bound by his word to serve the Queen, lures Amarendra by feigning he is in trouble, and then stabs him in the back and kills him.

After Amarendra's death, Kattappa soon learns of  Bhallaladeva's treachery and informs Sivagami, who reveals to the panicked hordes outside her palace that Amarendra is dead and that the baby Mahendra Baahubali has ascended the throne. As Bhallaladeva and his men are about to seize the queen, she flees with the new King but falls into a river after being hit by an arrow shot by Bhallaladeva. As Bhallaladeva holds Devasena prisoner for the next 25 years and destroys Kuntala, Mahendra grows up and leads the rebel group that has indulged in guerrilla warfare against King Bhallaladeva.

After listening to the whole story, Mahendra Baahubali (alias Sivudu) decides to avenge his father's death by raising his own army with the help of Kattappa and returns to Mahishmati along with Avantika and the people of the city. After an ensuing battle, Bhallaladeva is defeated by Mahendra and burnt alive on a pyre prepared by Devasena. Ending the cruel regime of Bhallaladeva, Mahendra becomes the new King with Avantika as his queen, bringing peace and harmony to Mahishmati.

[[Kanniks Kannikeswaran]] writes the characters resemble those &quot;from [[Chandamama]] issues from the 1960s and 70s&quot; and feels that the &quot;plots and subplots that bear distinct similarities to themes from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.&quot; He calls Amarendra the &quot;perfect Rama,&quot; while calling Bhallaladeva &quot;Duryodana incarnate, an atatayi.&quot; Bijjaladeva is compared to Shakuni, while the death of Bhadrudu is compared to Jayadratha's death in the Mahabharata. Kannikeswaran also feels that the film has visual parallels with ''The Lion King'', while also noting the similarities with ''Mulan''. Writing about the similarities with the latter, he states, &quot;Mulan pins a villain to a roof where he is reduced to ashes right in the midst of a firework display. The evil Bhallala is pinned with a sword to the ‘chita’ pyre that consumes him in the final frames of the film.&quot; He calls the film &quot;Shivocentric,&quot; noting the appearance of a Shivatandava stotra and that Shiva is the tutelage deity of Mahishmati. The main character is healed by Shiva in the end of the film, while noting Ganesha also makes an appearance in a fire ritual.&lt;ref name=&quot;swarajya2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://swarajyamag.com/blogs/the-meaning-of-bahubali |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171219191921/https://swarajyamag.com/blogs/the-meaning-of-bahubali |archivedate=19 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chandan Gowda, a professor at the [[Azim Premji University]], &quot;the social order [in the film] appears to be a varna order: Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas are named with the Shudras staying an unnamed presence,&quot; also noting that &quot;Muslims are also part of the Mahishmati kingdom.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mirror1&quot;/&gt; [[Mahesh Kathi]] felt that the modules and imagery were borrowed from Indian epics like Mahabharata and called Prabhas' character &quot;a mix of the Pandavas put together,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/is-baahubali-2-a-hindu-film-bahubali-2-religion-rajamouli-3416228.html |title=Is Baahubali 2 a Hindu film?

Baahubali goes for black and white: its heroes are wholly good and the villains pure evil.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mirror1&quot;/&gt; According to Gowda, the palace scenes resemble those in ''Ben Hur'' (1959) and ''Troy'' (2004) while the fight sequences are similar to the Chinese films ''Crouching Tiger'', ''Hidden Dragon'' (2000).&lt;ref name=&quot;mirror1&quot;/&gt;

Simon Abrams of [[RogerEbert.com]] gave the film a 4/4 rating and writes the film &quot;is everything I want but rarely get from superhero and big-budget fantasy movie&quot; adding &quot;the fight scenes... are so creative that they make even the most frequently abused creative shortcuts seem novel, everything from computer-generated imagery (CGI) to speed-ramping... You care what happens to the cast as they, aided by wires, hurl volleys of arrows at disposable minions and CGI animals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/baahubali-2-the-conclusion-2017 Baahubali 2: The Conclusion Movie Review (2017)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505153916/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/baahubali-2-the-conclusion-2017 |date= 5 May 2017 }}. Roger Ebert. Retrieved 8 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Anita Iyer from ''[[Khaleej Times]]'' rates the film 3.5 out of 5 and writes, &quot;What stands out in the film is the powerful star cast. Enough has been said already about the acting prowess of Prabhas but he has an equally supportive cast to hold the film. Ramya Krishnan as Sivagami, is known for her impressive acting talent and proves her mettle here. Another veteran, Sathyaraj as Katappa excels and you develop a camaraderie with him. Rana Daggubati is aptly spiteful in his portrayal of the villain... Nassar, as his father, is busy spewing venom but his role could have been meatier.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.khaleejtimes.com/citytimes/movie-reviews/bahubali-2--a-must-watch-blockbuster |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606050702/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/citytimes/movie-reviews/bahubali-2--a-must-watch-blockbuster |archivedate=6 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film received appreciation from members of the Indian film industry.
[[Rajinikanth]] praised ''The Conclusion'', calling Rajamouli &quot;god's own child&quot; and equating the film to &quot;Indian cinema's pride.&quot; [[Chiranjeevi]] praised the film and stated that Rajamouli &quot;deserved all accolades&quot; for making the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.indiatoday.in/story/chiranjeevi-on-baahubali-2-rajamouli-prabhas-rana-anushka/1/942174.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906200721/http://m.indiatoday.in/story/chiranjeevi-on-baahubali-2-rajamouli-prabhas-rana-anushka/1/942174.html |archivedate=6 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahesh Bhatt]] called it &quot;a game changer&quot; that &quot;redefines everything you thought u knew &amp; understood about Indian movies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news18.com/news/movies/baahubali-2-is-a-game-changer-for-indian-cinema-mahesh-bhatt-1387571.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609024255/http://www.news18.com/news/movies/baahubali-2-is-a-game-changer-for-indian-cinema-mahesh-bhatt-1387571.html |archivedate=9 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter [[Alia Bhatt]] called the film a &quot;rock buster.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/baahubali-2-the-conclusion-times-when-the-s-s-rajamouli-epic-made-headlines/alia-bhatt-calls-baahubali-2-the-conclusion-a-rock-buster/photostory/58730865.cms |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613190143/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/Baahubali-2-The-Conclusion-Times-when-the-S-S-Rajamouli-epic-made-headlines/Alia-Bhatt-calls-Baahubali-2-The-Conclusion-a-rock-buster/photostory/58730865.cms |archivedate=13 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahesh Babu]] stated the film &quot;exceed expectations,&quot; while [[Shekhar Kapur]] congratulated Rajamouli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/baahubali-2-shekhar-kapur-mahesh-babu-laud-rajamouli-film/1/941460.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505202543/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/baahubali-2-shekhar-kapur-mahesh-babu-laud-rajamouli-film/1/941460.html |archivedate=5 May 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shah Rukh Khan]], despite not watching the film, praised it and said, &quot;But if you want to create that big cinema and that big dream to sell to a big number of people, you have to have guts to take that storytelling on and say it in the biggest, nicest, boldest way possible.

The figure of '''[[Macbeth]]''' and related themes from the tragic play by [[William Shakespeare]] have appeared in many examples of [[popular culture]] since being authored by Shakespeare in the early 16th century.

==In film==
The earliest known film ''Macbeth'' was 1905's American short ''Death Scene From Macbeth'', and short versions were produced in Italy in 1909 and France in 1910. Two notable early versions are lost: Ludwig Landmann produced a 47-minute version in Germany in 1913, and [[D. W. Griffith]] produced a 1916 version in America featuring the noted stage actor [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]].&lt;ref&gt;Brode (2001, 177)&lt;/ref&gt; Tree is said to have had great difficulties adapting to the new medium, and especially in confining himself to the small number of lines in the (silent) screenplay, until an ingenious cameraman allowed him to play his entire part to an empty camera, after which a real camera shot the film.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman (2000, 49)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century===
{{main article|Macbeth on screen}}
In 1947, [[David Bradley (director)|David Bradley]] produced an independent film of ''Macbeth'', intended for distribution to schools, most notable for the designer of its eighty-three costumes: the soon-to-be-famous [[Charlton Heston]].&lt;ref&gt;Brode (2001, 178&amp;ndash;179)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Orson Welles as Macbeth.jpg|thumb|[[Orson Welles]] and [[Jeanette Nolan]] as Macbeth and Lady Macbeth in Welles' 1948 film adaptation of the play.]]
[[Orson Welles]]' 1948 ''[[Macbeth (1948 film)|Macbeth]]'', in the director's words a &quot;violently sketched charcoal drawing of a great play,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Orson Welles, cited by Rosenthal (2007, 99)&lt;/ref&gt; was filmed in only 23 days and on a budget of just $700,000. These filming conditions allowed only a single abstract set, and eclectic costumes. Dialogue was pre-recorded, enabling the actors to perform very long individual takes, including one of over ten minutes surrounding the death of Duncan.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal (2007, 98&amp;ndash;99)&lt;/ref&gt; Welles himself played the central character, who dominates the film, measured both by his time on screen, and by physical presence: high-angle and low-angle shots and deep-focus close-ups are used to distort his size in comparison to other characters.&lt;ref&gt;Guntner (2000, 124)&lt;/ref&gt; Welles retained from his own 1936 stage production the image of a [[Haitian Vodou|Voodoo doll]] controlling the fate of the central character: and at the end it is the doll we see beheaded.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth (2000, 284&amp;ndash;285)&lt;/ref&gt; The film's allegorical aspect is heightened by Welles' introduction of a non-Shakespearean character, the Holy Father (played by [[Alan Napier]]),&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal (2007, 99)&lt;/ref&gt; in opposition to the witches, speaking lines taken from Shakespeare's Ross, Angus and the Old Man.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (2000, 188&amp;ndash;189)&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary reviews were largely negative, particularly criticising Welles' unsympathetic portrayal of the central character. ''Newsweek'' commented: &quot;His Macbeth is a static, two-dimensional creature as capable of evil in the first scene as in the final hours of his bloody reign.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brode (2001, 183)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Joe MacBeth]]'' ([[Ken Hughes]], 1955) established the tradition of resetting the ''Macbeth'' story among 20th-century gangsters.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal (2007, 100&amp;ndash;102)&lt;/ref&gt; Others to do so include ''[[Men of Respect]]'' (William Reilly, 1991),&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal (2007, 110&amp;ndash;111)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Maqbool]]'' ([[Vishal Bhardwaj]], 2003)&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenthal 2007, 123-124&quot;&gt;Rosenthal (2007, 123&amp;ndash;124)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Geoffrey Wright]]'s Australian 2006 ''[[Macbeth (2006 film)|Macbeth]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenthal 2007, 127-128&quot;&gt;Rosenthal (2007, 127&amp;ndash;128)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, [[Akira Kurosawa]] used the ''Macbeth'' story as the basis for the &quot;universally acclaimed&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guntner (2000, 125)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Throne of Blood|Kumunosu-jo]]'' (in English known as ''Throne of Blood'' or (the literal translation of its title) ''Spiderweb Castle'').&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal (2007, 103)&lt;/ref&gt; The film is a Japanese period-piece ([[Jidaigeki|jidai-geki]]), drawing upon elements of [[Noh|Noh theatre]], especially in its depiction of the evil spirit who takes the part of Shakespeare's witches, and of Asaji, the Lady Macbeth character, played by [[Isuzu Yamada]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal (2007, 103&amp;ndash;104)&lt;/ref&gt; and upon [[Kabuki|Kabuki Theatre]] in its depiction of Washizu, the Macbeth character, played by [[Toshiro Mifune]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard (2003, 617)&lt;/ref&gt; In a twist on Shakespeare's ending, the tyrant (having witnessed Spiderweb Forest come to Spiderweb Castle) is killed by volleys of arrows from his own archers after they come to the realization he also lied about the identity of their former master's murderer.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal (2007, 105)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Schaefer (director)|George Schaefer]] directed [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]] and [[Judith Anderson]] in a [[Macbeth (1960 American film)|1960 made-for-TV film]] which later had a limited European theatrical release. (The three had also worked together on the earlier ''[[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]'' [[Macbeth (1954 TV drama)|1954 TV version of the play]].)&lt;ref&gt;McKernan &amp; Terris (1994, 93)&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of the central couple was able to adapt their stage acting style to the screen successfully, leading to their roles being described by critics as &quot;recited&quot; rather than &quot;acted&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brode (2001, 185&amp;ndash;187)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman Polanski]]'s 1971 ''[[Macbeth (1971 film)|Macbeth]]'' was the director's first film after the brutal murder of his wife, [[Sharon Tate]], and reflected his determination to &quot;show [''Macbeth''{{'}}s] violence the way it is ... [because] if you don't show it realistically then that's immoral and harmful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal (2007, 107&amp;ndash;108)&lt;/ref&gt; His film showed deaths only reported in the play, including the execution of Cawdor, and Macbeth stabbing Duncan,&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal (2007, 108)&lt;/ref&gt; and its violence was &quot;intense and incessant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brode (2001, 189)&lt;/ref&gt; Made in the aftermath of [[Franco Zeffirelli|Zeffirelli]]'s youthful ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', and financed by ''[[Playboy]]'' mogul [[Hugh Hefner]], Polanski's film featured a young sexy lead couple, played by [[Jon Finch]] (28) and by [[Francesca Annis]] (25), who controversially performed the sleepwalking scene nude.&lt;ref&gt;Brode (2001, 187&amp;ndash;189), Rosenthal (2007, 107&amp;ndash;109)&lt;/ref&gt; The unsettling film score, provided by the [[Third Ear Band]], invoked &quot;discord and dissonance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sanders (2007, 147)&lt;/ref&gt; While using Shakespeare's words, Polanski alters aspects of Shakespeare's story, turning the minor character Ross into a ruthless Machiavellian,&lt;ref&gt;Brode (2001, 191)&lt;/ref&gt; and adding an epilogue to the play in which Donalbain (younger son of Duncan) arrives at the witches' lair, indicating that the cycle of violence will begin again.&lt;ref&gt;Guntner (2000, 126&amp;ndash;127)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the Virginia Museum Theater (VMT, now the [[Leslie Cheek Theater]]), presented ''Macbeth,'' starring [[E.G. Marshall]].  Dubbed by the ''New York Times'' as the &quot;'Fowler' Macbeth&quot; after director [[Keith Fowler]], it was described by Clive Barnes as &quot;splendidly vigorous, forcefully immediate... probably the goriest Shakespearean production I have seen since Peter Brook's 'Titus Andronicus'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CLIVE BARNES Special to The New York Times |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB071FF83C54137A93C0A81789D85F478785F9 |title=Stage - Fowler 'Macbeth' - A Vigorous Production Staged in Richmond The Cast - Article - NYTimes.com |publisher=New York Times |date=1973-02-12 |accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nunn/McKellen/Dench [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]] [[The Other Place (theatre)|Other Place]] stage performance discussed above was adapted for TV and broadcast by [[Thames Television]] (see ''[[Macbeth (1978 film)]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Willems (2000, 36); McKernan &amp; Terris (1994, 99)&lt;/ref&gt;

William Reilly's 1991 ''[[Men of Respect]]'', another film to set the ''Macbeth'' story among gangsters, has been praised for its accuracy in depicting [[American Mafia|Mafia]] rituals, said to be more authentic than those in ''[[The Godfather]]'' or ''[[Goodfellas|GoodFellas]]''. However the film failed to please audiences or critics: Leonard Maltin found it &quot;pretentious&quot; and &quot;unintentionally comic&quot; and Daniel Rosenthal describes it as &quot;providing the most risible chunks of modernised Shakespeare in screen history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brode (2001, 193); Rosenthal (2007, 110)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 [[S4C]] produced a cel-animated ''Macbeth'' for the series ''[[Shakespeare: The Animated Tales]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Holland (2007, 43)&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1997 Jeremy Freeston directed [[Jason Connery]] and [[Helen Baxendale]] in a low budget, fairly full-text, version.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal (2007, 112&amp;ndash;3)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shakespeare's script, the actor playing Banquo must enter the stage as a ghost. The major film versions have usually taken the opportunity to provide a double perspective: Banquo visible to the audience from Macbeth's perspective, but invisible from the perspective of other characters. Television versions, however, have often taken the third approach of leaving Banquo invisible to viewers, thereby portraying Banquo's ghost as merely Macbeth's delusion. This approach is taken in the 1978 [[Thames Television|Thames TV]] production, [[Jack Gold]]'s 1983 version for [[BBC Television Shakespeare]], and in [[Penny Woolcock]]'s 1997 ''Macbeth on the Estate''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forsyth 2000, 289-290&quot;&gt;Forsyth (2000, 289&amp;ndash;290)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Macbeth on the Estate'' largely dispensed with the supernatural in favour of the drug-crime driven realism of characters living on a [[Birmingham]] housing estate: except for the three &quot;weird&quot; (in the modern sense of the word) children who prophesy Macbeth's fate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forsyth 2000, 289-290&quot;/&gt; This production used Shakespeare's language, but encouraged the actors &amp;ndash; many of whom were locals, not professionals &amp;ndash; to speak it naturalistically.&lt;ref&gt;Howard (2003, 618)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twenty-first century===
Twenty-first-century cinema has re-interpreted ''Macbeth'', relocating &quot;Scotland&quot; elsewhere: ''[[Maqbool]]'' to Mumbai, ''[[Scotland, PA]]'' to Pennsylvania, [[Geoffrey Wright]]'s ''[[Macbeth (2006 film)|Macbeth]]'' to Melbourne, and Allison L. LiCalsi's 2001 ''Macbeth: The Comedy'' to a location only differentiated from the reality of New Jersey, where it was filmed, through signifiers such as tartan, Scottish flags and bagpipes.&lt;ref&gt;Jess-Cooke (2006, 174&amp;ndash;175)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Abela]]'s 2001 ''[[Makibefo]]'' was set among, and starred, residents of [[Faux Cap]], a remote fishing community in Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal (2007, 114&amp;ndash;117)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonardo Henriquez]]' 2000 ''[[Sangrador]]'' (in English: ''Bleeder'') set the story among Venezuelan bandits and presented a shockingly visualised horror version.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal (2007, 118&amp;ndash;120)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Billy Morrissette]]'s ''[[Scotland, PA]]'' reframes the ''Macbeth'' story as a comedy-thriller set in a 1975 fast-food restaurant, and features [[James LeGros]] in the Macbeth role and [[Maura Tierney]] as Pat, the Lady Macbeth character: &quot;We're not bad people, Mac. We're just under-achievers who have to make up for lost time.&quot; [[Christopher Walken]] plays vegetarian detective Ernie McDuff who (in the words of Daniel Rosenthal) &quot;[applies] his uniquely offbeat menacing delivery to innocuous lines.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal (2007, 121&amp;ndash;122)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scotland, PA'''s conceit of resetting the ''Macbeth'' story at a restaurant was followed in [[BBC Television]]'s 2005 [[ShakespeaRe-Told]] adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal (2007, 122)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vishal Bhardwaj]]'s 2003 ''[[Maqbool]]'', filmed in [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]] and set in the [[Organised crime in India#Mumbai underworld|Mumbai underworld]], was produced in the [[Bollywood]] tradition, but heavily influenced by ''Macbeth'', by [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s 1972 ''[[The Godfather]]'' and by [[Luc Besson]]'s 1994 ''[[Léon: The Professional|Léon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jess-Cooke (2006, 177&amp;ndash;178)&lt;/ref&gt; It deviates from the ''Macbeth'' story in making the Macbeth character (Miyan Maqbool, played by [[Irrfan Khan|Irfan Khan]]) a single man, lusting after the mistress (Nimmi, played by [[Tabu (actress)|Tabbu]]) of the Duncan character (Jahangir Khan, known as Abbaji, played by [[Pankaj Kapur|Pankaj Kapoor]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenthal 2007, 123-124&quot;/&gt; Another deviation is the comparative delay in the murder: Shakespeare's protagonists murder Duncan early in the play, but more than half of the film has passed by the time Nimmi and Miyan kill Abbaji.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal (2007, 124)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 an &quot;eccentric&quot; Swedish/Norwegian film, based on [[Alex Scherpf]]'s Ice Globe Theatre production of ''Macbeth'', was said by critic Daniel Rosenthal to owe &quot;more to co-director [[Bo Landin]]'s background in natural history documentaries than to Shakespeare.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal (2007, 125&amp;ndash;126)&lt;/ref&gt; More conventional adaptations of 21st-century stage productions to television include [[Gregory Doran|Greg Doran]]'s [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]] production filmed in 2001 with [[Antony Sher]] and [[Harriet Walter]] in the central roles,&lt;ref&gt;Walter (2002, 65)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rupert Goold]]'s [[Chichester Festival Theatre]] ''[[Macbeth (2010 film)|Macbeth]]'' televised in 2010 with [[Patrick Stewart]] and [[Kate Fleetwood]] as the tragic couple. The cast of the latter felt that the history of their stage performance (moving from a [[Chichester Festival Theatre|small space]] at Chichester to a [[Gielgud Theatre|large proscenium arch stage]] in London to a [[Brooklyn Academy of Music|huge auditorium]] in Brooklyn) made it easier for them to &quot;re-scale&quot;, yet again, their performances for the cameras.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[Kate Fleetwood]] on DVD of [[Macbeth (2010 film)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Geoffrey Wright]] directed a Shakespearean-language, extremely violent ''[[Macbeth (2006 film)|Macbeth]]'' set in the Melbourne underworld. [[Sam Worthington]] played Macbeth. [[Victoria Hill]] played Lady Macbeth and shared the screenplay credits with Wright.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenthal 2007, 127-128&quot;/&gt; The director considered her portrayal of Lady Macbeth to be the most sympathetic he had ever seen.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[Geoffrey Wright]] in &quot;Making of Documentary&quot; on DVD of [[Macbeth (2006 film)]]&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the high level of violence and nudity (Macbeth has sex with the three naked schoolgirl witches as they prophesy his fate), intended to appeal to the young audiences that had flocked to ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'', the film flopped at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal (2007, 127)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, ''[[Classic Alice]]'' wove a 10 episode arc placing its characters in the world of Macbeth. The adaptation uses students and a modern-day setting to loosely parallel Shakespeare's play. It starred [[Kate Hackett]], [[Chris O'Brien (actor)|Chris O'Brien]], [[Elise Cantu]] and [[Tony Noto]] and embarked on a [[LGBTQ]] plotline.

[[Justin Kurzel]]'s feature-length adaptation ''[[Macbeth (2015 film)|Macbeth]]'', starring [[Michael Fassbender]] and [[Marion Cotillard]], was released in October 2015.

Also in 2015, Brazilian film ''A Floresta que se Move'' (''The Moving Forest'') premiered at the [[Montreal World Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ffm-montreal.org/en/636-en_the-moving-forest.html | author= | title=A Floresta que se Move / The Moving Forest| work=Montreal World Film Festival webpage |  accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directed by Vinícius Coimbra and starred by [[Gabriel Braga Nunes]] and [[Ana Paula Arósio]], the film uses a modern-day setting, replacing the throne of Scotland with the presidency of a high-ranked bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peliculacriativa.com.br/2015/08/ana-paula-arosio-volta-ao-cinema-em-a-floresta-que-se-move-de-vinicius-coimbra.html| author=Lynn Colling | title=Ana Paula Arósio volta ao cinema em 'A Floresta que se Move', filme dirigido por Vinícius Coimbra| work=Película Criativa | language=Portuguese| accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cultura.estadao.com.br/noticias/cinema,ana-paula-arosio-volta-as-telas-em-a-floresta-que-se-move,1577970| author=Flavia Guerra | title=Ana Paula Arósio volta às telas em 'A Floresta que se Move' | work=O Estado de São Paulo | language=Portuguese| accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://telatela.cartacapital.com.br/ana-paula-arosio-e-lady-macbeth-em-a-floresta-que-se-move/| author=Flavia Guerra | title=Ana Paula Arósio é Lady Macbeth em 'A Floresta que se Move' | work=Carta Capital| language=Portuguese| accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
There have been numerous literary adaptations and spin-offs from ''Macbeth''. Russian Novelist [[Nikolai Leskov|Nikolay Leskov]] told a variation of the story from Lady Macbeth's point of view in ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (novel)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'', which itself became a number of films&lt;ref&gt;Brode (2001, 192)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|an opera]] by [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanders (2007, 156)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurice Baring]]'s 1911 ''The Rehearsal'' fictionalises [[King's Men (playing company)|Shakespeare's company]]'s inept rehearsals for ''Macbeth's'' premiere.&lt;ref&gt;Lanier (2002, 119)&lt;/ref&gt; Gu Wuwei's 1916 play ''The Usurper of State Power'' adapted both ''Macbeth'' and ''Hamlet'' as a parody of contemporary events in China.&lt;ref&gt;Gillies (2002, 267)&lt;/ref&gt; The play has been used as a background for detective fiction (as in [[Marvin Kaye]]'s 1976 ''Bullets for Macbeth'')&lt;ref&gt;Osborne (2007, 129)&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the case of [[Ngaio Marsh]]'s last detective novel [[Light Thickens]], the play takes centre stage as the rehearsal, production and run of a 'flawless' production is described in absorbing detail (so much so that her biographer describes the novel as effectively Marsh's third production of the play).&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Lewis 'Ngaio March: A Life'&lt;/ref&gt; But the play was also used as the basis of [[James Thurber]]'s parody of the whodunit genre ''The Macbeth Murder Mystery'', in which the protagonist reads ''Macbeth'' applying the conventions of detective stories, and concludes that it must have been Macduff who murdered Duncan.&lt;ref&gt;Lanier (2002, 85)&lt;/ref&gt; Comics and graphic novels have utilised the play, or have dramatised the circumstances of its inception: [[Superman]] himself wrote the play for Shakespeare in the course of one night, in the 1947 ''Shakespeare's Ghost Writer''.&lt;ref&gt;Lanier (2002, 136&amp;ndash;137)&lt;/ref&gt; A cyberpunk version of MacBeth titled ''Mac'' appears in the collection ''Sound &amp; Fury: Shakespeare Goes Punk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Sound-Fury-Shakespeare-Goes-Punk-ebook/dp/B00UIL0YP2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1434308358&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sound+and+fury+punk Sound &amp; Fury: Shakespeare Goes Punk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Macbeth has been adapted into plays dealing with the political and cultural concerns of many nations. [[Eugène Ionesco]]'s ''[[Macbett]]'' satirised ''Macbeth'' as a meaningless succession of treachery and slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;Hortmann (2002, 219)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wale Ogunyemi]]'s ''A'are Akogun'', first performed in Nigeria in 1968, mixed the English and [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (2002, 292)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Welcome Msomi]]'s 1970 play ''[[uMabatha|Umabatha]]'' adapts ''Macbeth'' to Zulu culture, and was said by ''[[The Independent]]'' to be &quot;more authentic than any modern ''Macbeth''&quot; in presenting a world in which a man's fighting ability is central to his identity.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (2002, 286&amp;ndash;287), citing ''[[The Independent]]'' 8 August 1997&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe de Graft]] adapted ''Macbeth'' as a battle to take over a powerful corporation in Ghana in his 1972 ''Mambo'' or ''Let's Play Games, My Husband''.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (2002, 296)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dev Virahsawmy]]'s ''Zeneral Macbeff'', first performed in 1982, adapted the story to the local [[Mauritian creole|Creole]] and to the [[Mauritius|Mauritian]] political situation.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (2002, 289&amp;ndash;292)&lt;/ref&gt; (The same author later translated ''Macbeth'' itself into Mauritian creole, as ''Trazedji Makbess''.)&lt;ref&gt;Banham (2002, 289)&lt;/ref&gt; And in 2000, Chuck Mike and the Nigerian Performance Studio Workshop produced ''Mukbutu'' as a direct commentary on the fragile nature of Nigerian democracy at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (2002, 297)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music and audio==
[[File:Drexel 4175 9.jpg|thumb|&quot;Come away, Hecket&quot; composed by [[Robert Johnson (English composer)|Robert Johnson]] as it appears in [[Drexel 4175]]]]
''Macbeth'' is, with ''[[The Tempest]]'', one of the two most-performed Shakespeare plays on [[BBC Radio]], with 20 productions between 1923 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhalgh (2007, 186 and footnote 39 on 197)&lt;/ref&gt;

The extant version of ''Macbeth'', in the [[First Folio]], contains dancing and music, including the song &quot;Come Away Hecate&quot; which exists in two collections of lute music (both c.1630, one of them being [[Drexel 4175]]) arranged by [[Robert Johnson (English composer)|Robert Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooke (2008, 225)&lt;/ref&gt; And, from the Restoration onwards, incidental music has frequently been composed for the play: including works by [[William Boyce (composer)|William Boyce]] in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders (2007, 32)&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Davenant|Davenant]]'s use of dance in the witches' scenes was inherited by [[David Garrick|Garrick]], which in turn influenced [[Giuseppe Verdi]] to incorporate a ballet around the witches' cauldron into his opera ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders (2007, 60)&lt;/ref&gt; Verdi's first Shakespeare-influenced opera, with libretto by [[Francesco Maria Piave]], incorporated a number of striking arias for Lady Macbeth, giving her a prominence in the early part of the play which contrasts with the character's increasing isolation as the action continues: she ceases to sing duets and her sleepwalking confession is starkly contrasted with the &quot;supported grief&quot; of Macduff in the preceding scene.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders (2007, 83 &amp; 112&amp;ndash;116)&lt;/ref&gt; Other music influenced by the play includes [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 symphonic poem ''[[Macbeth (Strauss)|Macbeth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders (2007, 16)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Billy Strayhorn]] incorporated themes depicting the female characters from ''Macbeth'' in the 1957 Shakespearean jazz suite ''[[Such Sweet Thunder]]'': the weird sisters juxtaposed with Iago (from ''[[Othello]]''), and ''Lady Mac'' represented by ragtime piano because, as Ellington put it, &quot;we suspect there was a little ragtime in her soul&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders (2007, 17 &amp; 20)&lt;/ref&gt; Another Jazz collaboration to create hybrids of Shakespeare plays was that of [[Cleo Laine]] with [[John Dankworth|Johnny Dankworth]], who in Laine's 1964 ''Shakespeare and All That Jazz'' juxtaposed Titania's instructions to her fairies from ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' with the witches' chant from ''Macbeth''.&lt;ref&gt;''Macbeth'' 1.1.10&amp;ndash;11; ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' 3.1.154&amp;ndash;166); Sanders (2007, 22&amp;ndash;23)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, [[Jag Panzer]] produced their heavy metal concept-album retelling ''[[Thane to the Throne]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lanier (2002, 72)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, pianist [[John Burke (American pianist)|John Burke]] scored an outdoor production of ''Macbeth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/atlanta/article/MACBETH-Slashes-Into-Serenbe-Playhouse-20170606 |title=MACBETH, Starring Justin Deeley, Slashes Into Serenbe Playhouse |publisher=Broadway World Atlanta |date=2017-06-06 |accessdate=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the visual arts==
The play has inspired numerous works of art. In 1750 and 1760 respectively, the painters [[John Wootton]] and [[Francesco Zuccarelli]] portrayed Macbeth and Banquo meeting the Three Witches in a scenic landscape, both likely having been inspired by [[Gaspard Dughet|Gaspard Dughet's]] 1653&amp;ndash;4 painting ''Landscape in a Storm''. While Wootton's extended visualization was ultimately more significant, Zuccarelli's allegorical version became available to a much wider constituency, through its 1767 exhibition with the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain|Society of Artists]] and its subsequent engraving by [[William Woollett]] in 1770.&lt;ref&gt;Sillars (2006, 1&amp;ndash;2, 77&amp;ndash;79)&lt;/ref&gt; The scene in which Lady Macbeth seizes the daggers, as performed by [[David Garrick|Garrick]] and [[Hannah Pritchard|Mrs. Pritchard]], was a touchstone throughout [[Henry Fuseli]]'s career, including works in 1766, 1774 and 1812.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orgel 2007, 74&quot;&gt;Orgel (2007, 74)&lt;/ref&gt; The same performance was the subject of [[Johann Zoffany]]'s painting of the Macbeths in 1768.&lt;ref&gt;Orgel (2002, 247&amp;ndash;249)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1786, [[John Boydell]] announced his intention to found his [[Boydell Shakespeare Gallery|Shakespeare Gallery]]. His chief innovation was to see the works of Shakespeare as history, rather than contemporary, so instead of including the (then fashionable) works depicting the great actors of the day on stage in modern dress, he commissioned works depicting the ''action'' of the plays.&lt;ref&gt;Orgel (2007, 75)&lt;/ref&gt; However the most notable works in the collection disregard this historicising principle: such as [[Henry Fuseli|Fuseli]]'s depiction of the naked and heroic Macbeth encountering the witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orgel 2007, 76&quot;&gt;Orgel (2007, 76)&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Blake]]'s paintings were also influenced by Shakespeare, including his ''Pity'', inspired by Macbeth's &quot;Pity, like a naked new-born babe, striding the blast.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Macbeth 1 2007&quot;&gt;''Macbeth'' 1.7.21&amp;ndash;22; Orgel (2007, 77)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarah Siddons]]' triumph in the role of Lady Macbeth led [[Joshua Reynolds]] to depict her as ''The Muse of Tragedy''.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Penny. &quot;Women and Shakespearean Performance&quot;, in Wells and Stanton (2002, 155–173) p159.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[Mordred]], an iron-fisted [[warlock]], and his armies lay siege to [[Camelot]], seeking to establish the dominance of magic-wielding [[Magician (paranormal)|mages]] over humankind. [[Uther Pendragon]], king of the [[Britons]], infiltrates Mordred's lair and beheads him, saving Camelot. Uther's treacherous brother [[Vortigern]], who covets the throne, orchestrates a coup and sacrifices his wife Elsa to [[moat]] [[hag]]s to become a demon knight, who kills Uther's wife and slays him in combat. The only survivor is Uther's son, who drifts away in a boat and ends up in [[Londinium]], where he is found and raised by prostitutes.

[[King Arthur|Arthur]] grows into a skilled fighter and man of the streets. Arthur and his friends confront a group of [[Vikings]] who had mistreated one of the prostitutes, forcing him to pay her restitution. Afterwards, the brothel is raided by the Blacklegs, Vortigern's minions, and Arthur learns that the Vikings were under the king's protection. Arthur tries to escape the city but is caught and put on a ship with hundreds of other men; the Blacklegs have been forcing all men of Arthur's age to try to pull [[Excalibur|a sword that has appeared]] near the castle from the surrounding stone. Arthur is able to remove the sword but is quickly overwhelmed by its power and passes out. Vortigern meets with him in the dungeon, revealing his true lineage.

Meanwhile, a mage identifying herself as an acolyte of [[Merlin]] presents herself to Uther's former general, [[Bedivere|Sir Bedivere]]. At Arthur's planned execution, the mage uses her magic to stage a diversion while Bedivere's men rescue Arthur. Taken to Bedivere's hideout, Arthur initially refuses to help them. The mage persuades Bedivere to take Arthur to a realm called the &quot;Darklands,&quot; where he's given a vision of how Uther sacrificed himself to save Arthur and entomb the [[Excalibur#Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone|sword in stone]]. Arthur learns Vortigern was responsible for persuading Mordred to rebel against humanity, and he returns determined to destroy Vortigern.

With his friends and Bedivere's men, Arthur stages a series of ambushes against Vortigern, culminating in an assassination attempt in Londinium. The rebels sense a trap but attack anyway, fleeing to a fighters' school run by Arthur's mentor George, where they are overrun by the Blacklegs. Seeing the mage held at knifepoint, Arthur unleashes Excalibur's potential, single-handedly killing all of the soldiers. The rebels are able to escape the city except for Arthur's injured friend Back Lack, who is killed at Vortigern's hand in front of his son Blue.

Ashamed of his failures, Arthur tries to throw away the sword, but the [[Lady of the Lake]] returns it and shows him a vision of England's future under Vortigern's rule. Coming to terms with his responsibility, Arthur reunites with Bedivere. When they return to the rebel hideout, however, they discover all of their allies dead, Vortigern having found them and delivered an ultimatum: if Arthur does not surrender himself, the captured mage and Blue will die. Arthur surrenders himself, but as Vortigern is about to execute his nephew, a giant snake summoned by the mage attacks and devours Vortigern's men. While Bedivere and the others lead an attack on the castle, a desperate Vortigern sacrifices his only daughter and is transformed into the demon knight, confronting Arthur in a separate dimension. Despite his fighting skill, Arthur is beaten, and he is about to submit when he witnesses a vision of his father, convincing him to accept the sword and his character as his own. Arthur violently slays Vortigern but blesses him as he dies.

In the aftermath, Arthur dissolves Vortigern's pact with the Vikings and begins building a [[Round Table]] where his knighted friends will meet. Blue and the prostitutes arrive with the crown of Uther, which Arthur accepts, holding the sword aloft.

==Production==
{{expand section|date=March 2018}}
After 2004's ''King Arthur'', Warner Brothers made multiple attempts to make a new film based on Arthurian legend: One was to be a remake of ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'', helmed by [[Bryan Singer]], while the other was a movie to have been titled ''Arthur &amp; Lancelot'', which would have starred [[Kit Harington]] and [[Joel Kinnaman]], as King Arthur and Lancelot respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fallofcamelot&quot;/&gt; Warner Brothers worried that names were not big enough, and attempted to replace both actors with more profitable ones, before eventually dropping the project all together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fallofcamelot&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Adam|title=The fall of Camelot: how Guy Ritchie's King Arthur became a $175 million box office bomb|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/guy-ritchies-king-arthur-became-175-million-box-office-bomb/|website=The Guardian|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warner's next attempt to create a new King Arthur film was an attempt to create an Arthurian [[cinematic universe]] which would span six films, following different characters before their eventual team up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fallofcamelot&quot;/&gt; For this endeavour they hired director [[Guy Ritchie]], who has himself attempted to make a King Arthur movie prior to that. According to ''The Guardian'', the script soon became &quot;a strange Frankenstein's Monster-style screenplay&quot; incorporating elements from several of the unproduced Arthurian scripts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fallofcamelot&quot;/&gt;

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 29% based on 230 reviews and an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 4.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, &quot;''King Arthur: Legend of the Sword'' piles mounds of modern action flash on an age-old tale – and wipes out much of what made it a classic story in the first place.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/king_arthur_legend_of_the_sword|title=King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalised rating, the film has a score 41 out of 100 based 45 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/king-arthur-legend-of-the-sword|title=King Arthur: Legend of the Sword reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[CinemaScore]], audiences gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale, while [[PostTrak]] reporter filmgoers gave it an overall positive score of 78%; 56% of the opening weekend filmgoers were under the age of 35, and 59% were men.&lt;ref name=opening/&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Peter Bradshaw]] gave the film a generally positive review: &quot;Guy Ritchie’s cheerfully ridiculous Arthur is a gonzo monarch, a death-metal warrior-king. Ritchie’s film is at all times over the top, crashing around its digital landscapes in all manner of beserkness, sometimes whooshing along, sometimes stuck in the odd narrative doldrum. But it is often surprisingly entertaining, and whatever clunkers he has delivered in the past, Ritchie again shows that a film-maker of his craft and energy commands attention, and part of his confidence in reviving King Arthur resides here in being so unselfconscious and unconcerned about the student canon that has gone before.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bradshaw |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Bradshaw |date=9 May 2017 |title=Review of Guy Ritchie's ''King Arthur'' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/09/king-arthur-the-legend-of-the-sword-review-guy-ritchies-den-of-medieval-dodginess |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |access-date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pan of the film for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] questioned the long-term longevity of the projected series of six ''Arthur'' films from Ritchie: &quot;I'm no businessman, but plans for a six-film franchise may be optimistic. Optimism is nowhere to be found in Ritchie's movie itself. It is a grim and stupid thing, from one of the world's most successful mediocre filmmakers, and if [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[King Lear]] were blogging today, he'd supply the [[blurb]] quote: 'Nothing will come of nothing.'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Phillips. {{citation|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-king-arthur-mov-rev-0509-20170511-column.html|title=Review of Guy Ritchie's ''King Arthur''}} ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matt Zoller Seitz]] of [[RogerEbert.com]] gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars, stating that despite the potential for a revisionist King Arthur story with &quot;[t]he Ritchie sense of style&quot;, the overall problem is the film's lack of modulation: &quot;Ritchie keeps rushing us along for two hours, as if to make absolutely certain that we never have time to absorb any character or moment, much less revel in the glorious, cheeky ridiculousness of the whole thing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seitz|first1=Matt Zoller|title=King Arthur: Legend of the Sword Movie Review (2017) |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/king-arthur-legend-of-the-sword-2017 |publisher=RogerEbert.com |accessdate=14 May 2017|date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alissa Wilkinson of ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' writes that the film is &quot;surprisingly good, and surprisingly political&quot; in relation to the [[Brexit|British withdrawal from the European Union]], and &quot;occasionally, it's even pretty great&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/5/11/15508278/king-arthur-review-charlie-hunnam-guy-ritchie-jude-law &quot;King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is surprisingly good, and surprisingly political&quot;], Alissa Wilkinson. Vox.com. 11 May 2017. Retrieved 14 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Hartwell of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' expressed disappointment in the film's lackluster box office performance denying a sequel for the introduction of [[Merlin]], stating it would have been more successful as a solo film instead of setting up a franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/king-arthur-legend-sword-was-killed-by-sequel-1003593|title=How 'King Arthur' Was Killed by a Would-Be Franchise|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
=== Development ===
On September 28, 2016, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] confirmed that [[Jon Favreau]] would be directing a fast-tracked [[List of Disney live-action remakes of animated films|remake]] of the 1994 animated film ''[[The Lion King]]'', which would feature the songs from the 1994 film, following a string of recent box office successes on the other Disney remake films such as ''[[Maleficent (film)|Maleficent]]'', ''[[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[The Jungle Book (2016 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' and ''[[Beauty and the Beast (2017 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' with the latter three also earning critical praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disney and Jon Favreau Joining Forces on &quot;The Lion King&quot;|url=https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-jon-favreau-the-lion-king/|accessdate=September 28, 2016|work=The Walt Disney Company|date=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on October 13, it was reported that Disney had hired [[Jeff Nathanson]] to write the screenplay for the remake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Fleming Jr|title=Disney’s Live-Action 'Lion King' Taps Jeff Nathanson As Writer|url=http://deadline.com/2016/10/lion-king-movie-jeff-nathanson-writer-disney-jon-favreau-1201836009/|accessdate=October 16, 2016|work=Deadline|date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, talking with [[ComingSoon.net]], Favreau said the virtual cinematography technology he used in ''The Jungle Book'' would be used to a greater degree in ''The Lion King''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Busch|first=Jenna|title=Live-Action Lion King Movie to Use VR Tech|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/790753-jon-favreau-to-use-vr-tech-for-live-action-lion-king#/slide/1|accessdate=December 1, 2016|work=ComingSoon.net|date=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gladiator''''' is a 2000 [[Epic film|epic]] [[Historical period drama|historical drama film]] directed by [[Ridley Scott]] and written by  [[David Franzoni]], [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]], and [[William Nicholson (writer)|William Nicholson]]. It stars [[Russell Crowe]], [[Joaquin Phoenix]], [[Connie Nielsen]], [[Ralf Möller]], [[Oliver Reed]] (in his final role), [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Derek Jacobi]], [[John Shrapnel]], and [[Richard Harris]]. Crowe portrays [[Hispania|Hispano-Roman]] general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when [[Commodus]], the ambitious son of Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus rises through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena to avenge the murders of his family and his emperor.

The film was released in the United States on May 5, 2000. The film received favorable reviews from critics and grossed $457 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of 2000. The film won multiple awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Crowe and three other [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] at the [[73rd Academy Awards]]. It has also been credited with rekindling interest in entertainment centered around [[Culture of ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]], such as the TV series [[Rome TV series|''Rome'']].

==Plot==
In AD 180, [[Hispania|Hispano-Roman]] General Maximus Decimus Meridius intends to return to his home after he leads the [[Roman army]] to victory against the Germanic tribes near [[Vindobona]] on the [[Limes Germanicus]]. Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] tells Maximus that his own son, [[Commodus]], is unfit to rule and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to help save [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] from corruption. Commodus murders his father when he is told about the plan.

Commodus announces he is the new Emperor and asks Maximus for his loyalty, but the general refuses. Maximus is arrested by guards and is told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and rides for his home near Trujillo, where he finds his family murdered. Maximus buries his wife and son; then collapses. He is found by slavers who take him to the Roman province of Zucchabar, where he is sold to a [[Gladiator#Schools_and_training|gladiator trainer]] named Proximo.

Although reluctant at first, Maximus fights in local tournaments and makes friends with two other gladiators: Juba, a [[Numidia]]n; and Hagen, a German. His military skills help him win matches and gain recognition from other gladiators and the crowd. Proximo reveals that he was once a gladiator, and advises Maximus that he must &quot;win the crowd&quot; to win his freedom. Proximo takes his gladiators to fight in Rome's [[Colosseum]], because Commodus has organized 150 days of games.

Disguised by a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in gladiatorial combat in the Colosseum as a [[Sacred Band of Carthage|Carthaginian]] in a re-enactment of the [[Battle of Zama]]. Unexpectedly, Maximus leads his side to victory, and Commodus enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations. He orders the disguised Maximus, as leader of the gladiators, to show himself and give his name; Maximus reveals himself and declares vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let the gladiators live, and the [[Praetorian Guard]] is held back from striking them down. 

Maximus's next fight is a victory against a legendary undefeated gladiator. Commodus orders Maximus to kill the gladiator, but Maximus spares his opponent's life; he is called &quot;Maximus the Merciful&quot; by the crowd. Angered at this outcome, Commodus taunts Maximus about his family's deaths, but Maximus turns and walks away.

Maximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal. [[Lucilla]], Commodus's sister; Gracchus, an influential [[Senate of the Roman Empire|senator]]; and Maximus meet secretly. Maximus will escape Rome, join his soldiers, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the [[Roman Senate]]. Commodus learns of the plot by threatening Lucilla, and has the Praetorian Guard arrest Gracchus and attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where Cicero is killed.

Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum. He stabs Maximus before the match to gain an advantage. Maximus disarms Commodus, whom the Praetorian Guard refuse to aid. Commodus then produces a hidden knife, which Maximus drives into his throat, killing him. Maximus succumbs to his wound. Before he dies, he asks for political reforms, for his gladiator allies to be freed, and for Senator Gracchus to be reinstated. Maximus's friends and allies honor him as &quot;a soldier of Rome&quot;, at Lucilla's behest, and carry his body out of the arena, leaving the dead Commodus behind.

Juba visits the Colosseum at night and buries the figurines of Maximus's wife and son at the spot where he died. Juba says he is to return to his own family and promises to see Maximus again, &quot;but not yet&quot;.

==Cast==
* [[Russell Crowe]] as Maximus Decimus Meridius: a [[Hispania|Hispano-Roman]] [[legatus]] forced into becoming a slave who seeks revenge against Commodus. He has earned the favor of Marcus Aurelius, and the love and admiration of Lucilla prior to the events of the film. His home is near [[Trujillo, Cáceres|Trujillo]] in today's [[Province of Cáceres]], [[Spain]]. After the murder of his family he vows vengeance. Maximus is a fictional character partly inspired by [[Marcus Nonius Macrinus]], [[Narcissus (wrestler)|Narcissus]], [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus|Cincinnatus]], and [[Maximus of Hispania]]. [[Mel Gibson]] was first offered the role,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/movies/bestpictures/gladiator-re.html| title=The New York Times: Best Pictures| newspaper=New York Times| date= May 5, 2000 | author=Elvis Mitchell| accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but declined as he felt he was too old to play the character. [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Hugh Jackman]] were also considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://screencrush.com/gladiator-then-and-now/| title=See the Cast of 'Gladiator' Then and Now| newspaper=Screencrush.com| date=June 13, 2013 | author= Britt Hayes| accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Oliver Reed]] as Antonius Proximo: An old, gruff gladiator trainer who buys Maximus in North Africa. A former gladiator himself, he was freed by Marcus Aurelius, and gives Maximus his own armor and eventually a chance at freedom, and becomes somewhat of a mentor to Maximus. This was Reed's final film appearance, before he died during the filming. In the original film script, Proximo was supposed to live.

* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as Juba: A [[Numidia]]n tribesman who was taken from his home and family by slave traders. He becomes Maximus's closest ally and friend, and inspires Maximus to bring down Commodus for the greater good before he joins his family in the afterlife.
* [[Richard Harris]] as [[Marcus Aurelius]]: The old and wise emperor of Rome who appoints Maximus, whom he loves as a son, to be his successor, with the ultimate aim of returning Rome to a [[Roman Republic|republican form of government]].

==Production==

===Screenplay===
''Gladiator'' was based on an original pitch by [[David Franzoni]], who wrote the first draft.&lt;ref name=Stax&gt;{{Citation|title=The Stax Report's ''Five Scribes'' Edition|author=Stax|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/356/356712p1.html|publisher=IGN|date=April 4, 2002|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franzoni was given a three-picture deal with [[DreamWorks]] as writer and co-producer on the strength of his previous work, [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', which helped establish the reputation of DreamWorks. Not a classical scholar, Franzoni was inspired by [[Daniel P. Mannix]]'s 1958 novel ''Those About to Die,'' and he chose to base his story on Commodus after reading the ''[[Augustan History]]''. In Franzoni's first draft, dated April 4, 1998, he named his protagonist [[Narcissus (wrestler)|Narcissus]], a wrestler who, according to the ancient sources [[Herodian]] and [[Cassius Dio]], strangled Emperor Commodus to death.&lt;ref name=&quot;FilmHistoryWinkler&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Gladiator: Film and History|editor=Martin M. Winkler|chapter=Gladiator from Screenplay to Screen|author=Jon Solomon|publisher=Blackwell Publishing |date=April 1, 2004|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jean-Leon Gerome Pollice Verso.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Several dead men and various scattered weapons are located in a large arena. Near the center of the image is a man wearing armor standing in the middle of an arena looking up at a large crowd. The man has his right foot on the throat of an injured man who is reaching towards the crowd. Members of the crowd are indicating a &quot;thumbs down&quot; gesture. The arena is adorned with marble, columns, flags, and statues.|''[[Pollice Verso (Gérôme)|Pollice Verso (Thumbs Down)]]'' by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], the 19th-century painting that inspired Ridley Scott to tackle the project]]

[[Ridley Scott]] was approached by producers [[Walter Parkes|Walter F. Parkes]] and [[Douglas Wick]]. They showed him a copy of [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]'s 1872 painting entitled ''[[Pollice Verso (Gérôme)|Pollice Verso (Thumbs Down)]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 22&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott was enticed by filming the world of Ancient Rome. However, Scott felt Franzoni's dialogue was too &quot;on the nose&quot; (lacking subtlety) and hired [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]] to rewrite the script to his liking. Logan rewrote much of the first act and made the decision to kill off Maximus's family to increase the character's motivation.&lt;ref name=&quot;scribes&quot;&gt;{{cite video|title=Tales of the Scribes: Story Development|medium=DVD|publisher=Universal|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russell Crowe]] describes being eager for the role as pitched by Walter F. Parkes, in his interview for ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'': &quot;They said, 'It's a 100-million-dollar film. You're being directed by Ridley Scott. You play a Roman General.' I've always been a big fan of Ridley's.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kaspinet.com&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Inside the Actors Studio With Russell Crowe (transcript) |url=http://www.kaspinet.com/Inside_The_Actors_Studio-Transcript.htm |date=January 4, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324015003/http://www.kaspinet.com/Inside_The_Actors_Studio-Transcript.htm |medium=Television production |archive-date=March 24, 2015 |website=kaspinet.com |accessdate=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With two weeks to go before filming, the actors complained of problems with the script. [[William Nicholson (writer)|William Nicholson]] was brought to [[Shepperton Studios]] to make Maximus a more sensitive character.  Nicholson reworked Maximus' friendship with Juba and developed the afterlife thread in the film, saying &quot;he did not want to see a film about a man who wanted to kill somebody.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;scribes&quot;/&gt;

The screenplay faced many rewrites and revisions. Crowe allegedly questioned every aspect of the evolving script and strode off the set when he did not get answers. According to a DreamWorks executive, &quot;(Russell Crowe) tried to rewrite the entire script on the spot. You know the big line in the trailer, 'In this life or the next, I will have my vengeance'? At first he absolutely refused to say it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Corliss2000&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=The Empire Strikes Back|first1=Richard|last1=Corliss|first2=Jeffrey|last2=Ressner|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,996847-2,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=May 8, 2000|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell Crowe described the script situation: &quot;I read the script and it was substantially underdone. Even the character didn't exist on the pages. And that set about a long process, that's probably the first time that I've been in a situation where the script wasn't a complete done deal. We actually started shooting with about 32 pages and went through them in the first couple of weeks.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kaspinet.com&quot;/&gt;

Of the writing and filming process, Crowe added, &quot;Possibly, a lot of the stuff that I have to deal with now in terms of my quote unquote volatility has to do with that experience. Here was a situation where we got to Morocco with a crew of 200 and a cast of a 100 or whatever, and I didn't have anything to learn. I actually didn't know what the scenes were gonna be. We had, I think, one American writer working on it, one English writer working on it, and of course a group of producers who were also adding their ideas, and then Ridley himself; and then, on the occasion where Ridley would say, 'Look, this is the structure for it – what are you gonna say in that?' So then I'd be doing my own stuff, as well. And this is how things like, 'Strength and honor,' came up. This is how things like, 'At my signal, unleash hell,' came up. The name Maximus Decimus Meridius, it just flowed well.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kaspinet.com&quot;/&gt;

Maximus' habit of rubbing soil before each fight references the attachment and affection to his former life as a farmer.&lt;ref name=&quot;cyrino&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://faculty.uml.edu/Ethan_Spanier/Teaching/documents/CyrinoGaldiator.pdf|title=Gladiator and Contemporary American Society|publisher=University of Massachusetts Lowell| page=141|author=Monica S. Cyrino| accessdate =12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a conversation with Marcus Aurelius, Maximus says the fecund soil of his farm is &quot;black like my wife's hair&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cyrino&quot;/&gt; Crowe wrote the speech himself, drawing on his feelings of homesickness for his own ranch.&lt;ref name=&quot;cyrino&quot;/&gt;

===Pre-production===
In preparation for filming, Scott spent several months developing storyboards to develop the framework of the plot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 34&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over six weeks, production members scouted various locations within the extent of the Roman Empire before its collapse, including Italy, France, North Africa, and England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 61&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the film's props, sets, and costumes were manufactured by crew members due to high costs and unavailability of the items.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 66&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hundred suits of steel armour and 550 suits in polyurethane were made by Rod Vass and his company Armordillo. The unique sprayed-polyurethane system was developed by Armordillo and pioneered for this production. Over a three-month period, 27,500 component pieces of armor were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.themovienetwork.com/article/motw-sic-semper-illuminatus-five-fun-facts-about-gladiator| title=MOTW: Sic Semper Illuminatus: Five Fun Facts about &quot;Gladiator&quot;| newspaper=Themovienetwork.com| date=February 26, 2013 | author=| accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
The film was shot in three main locations between January and May 1999. The opening battle scenes in the forests of Germania were shot in three weeks in the [[Bourne Wood]]s, near [[Farnham]], [[Surrey]], in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 62&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Scott learned that the [[Forestry Commission]] planned to remove a section of the forest, he persuaded them to allow the battle scene to be shot there and burn it down.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 68&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson used multiple cameras filming at various frame rates and a [[Rotary disc shutter|45-degree shutter]], creating [[stop motion]] effects in the action sequences, similar to techniques used for the battle sequences of ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' (1998).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bankston2000&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Bankston|first=Douglas|date=May 2000|title=Death or Glory|journal=American Cinematographer|publisher=American Society of Cinematographers|url=http://www.ascmag.com/magazine/may00/pg1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the scenes of slavery, desert travel, and gladiatorial training school were shot in [[Ouarzazate]], Morocco, just south of the Atlas Mountains over a further three weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 63&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; To construct the arena where Maximus has his first fights, the crew used basic materials and local building techniques to manufacture the 30,000-seat mud brick arena.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 73&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the scenes of Ancient Rome were shot over a period of nineteen weeks in [[Fort Ricasoli]], Malta.&lt;ref name=Kodak_inCamera&gt;{{Citation|title=Gory glory in the Colosseum|url=http://www.kodak.com/US/en/motion/newsletters/inCamera/july2000/gladiator.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050209185727/http://www.kodak.com/US/en/motion/newsletters/inCamera/july2000/gladiator.shtml|archivedate=2005-02-09|publisher=Kodak: In Camera|date=July 2000|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mfc&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=Malta Film Commission&amp;nbsp;– Backlots |url=http://mfc.com.mt/page.asp?p=14388&amp;l=1 |publisher=Malta Film Commission |accessdate=28 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729093604/http://mfc.com.mt/page.asp?p=14388&amp;l=1 |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Malta, a replica of about one-third of Rome's Colosseum was built, to a height of 52 feet (15.8 meters), mostly from plaster and plywood (the other two-thirds and remaining height were added digitally).&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 89&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replica took several months to build and cost an estimated $1 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winkler p130&quot;&gt;Winkler, p.130&lt;/ref&gt; The reverse side of the complex supplied a rich assortment of Ancient Roman street furniture, [[colonnade]]s, [[gate]]s, [[statue|statuary]], and marketplaces for other filming requirements. The complex was serviced by tented &quot;costume villages&quot; that had changing rooms, storage, armorers, and other facilities.&lt;ref name=Kodak_inCamera/&gt; The rest of the Colosseum was created in [[computer-generated imagery]] using set-design blueprints and textures referenced from live action, and rendered in three layers to provide lighting flexibility for compositing in [[Autodesk Media and Entertainment|Flame]] and [[Autodesk Media and Entertainment|Inferno]] software.&lt;ref name=TheMill&gt;{{Citation|last=Bath| first=Matthew|title=The Mill|url=http://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/creative-lifestyle/mill/|publisher=Digit Magazine|date=October 25, 2004|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-production===
[[File:cityrome.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Men in white robes with the Colosseum in the background.|Several scenes included extensive use of computer-generated imagery shots for views of Rome.]]
British post-production company [[The Mill (post-production)|The Mill]] was responsible for much of the computer-generated imagery effects that were added after filming. The company was responsible for such tricks as compositing real tigers filmed on [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] into the fight sequences, and adding smoke trails and extending the flight paths of the opening scene's salvo of flaming arrows to get around regulations on how far they could be shot during filming.

An unexpected post-production job was caused by the death of [[Oliver Reed]] of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] during the filming in Malta, before all his scenes had been shot. The Mill created a digital [[body double]] for the remaining scenes involving his character Proximo&lt;ref name=TheMill/&gt; by photographing a live action body-double in the shadows and by mapping a three-dimensional computer-generated imagery mask of Reed's face to the remaining scenes during production at an estimated cost of $3.2 million for two minutes of additional footage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 123&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ORtwo&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2000-04-12#celeb4|title=Oliver Reed Resurrected On Screen|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|date=April 12, 2000|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visual effects supervisor [[John Nelson (visual effects artist)|John Nelson]] reflected on the decision to include the additional footage: &quot;What we did was small compared to our other tasks on the film.

==Historical authenticity==
[[File:Juba denarius in support of Pompey against Cesar 60 46 BCE.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[Numidia]]n king [[Juba I of Numidia|Juba]]. The Numidians were of [[Berber people|Berber]] origin, instead of sub-Saharan origin.]]

===Development===
The film is loosely based on real events that occurred within the [[Roman Empire]] in the latter half of the 2nd century AD. As Ridley Scott wanted to portray Roman culture more accurately than in any previous film, he hired several historians as advisors. Nevertheless, some deviations from historical fact were made to increase interest, maintain narrative continuity, and for practical or safety reasons. Scott also stated that due to the influence of previous films affecting the public perception of what ancient Rome was like, some historical facts were &quot;too unbelievable&quot; to include. For instance in an early version of the script, gladiators would have been carrying out [[Testimonial|product endorsements]] in the arena; while this would have been historically accurate, it was not filmed for fear that audiences would think it anachronistic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://au.movies.ign.com/articles/035/035289p1.html Not Such a Wonderful Life: A Look at History in Gladiator] IGN movies February 10, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one historical advisor resigned due to these changes. Another asked not to be mentioned in the credits (though it was stated in the director's commentary that he constantly asked, &quot;where is the proof that certain things were exactly like they say?&quot;). Historian Allen Ward of the University of Connecticut believed that historical accuracy would not have made ''Gladiator'' less interesting or exciting because &quot;creative artists need to be granted some poetic license, but that should not be a permit for the wholesale disregard of facts in historical fiction&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last =Ward|first =Allen|date =May 2001|title =The Movie &quot;Gladiator&quot; in Historical Perspective|work =[[University of Connecticut]]|url =http://ablemedia.com/ctcweb/showcase/wardgladiator1.html|accessdate =December 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GladFilmH&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Winkler|first=Martin |title=Gladiator Film and History|year=2004 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|isbn=1-4051-1042-2|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fictionalization===
*[[Marcus Aurelius]] was not murdered by his son Commodus; he died at [[Vindobona]] (modern [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]]) in 180 AD from the [[Antonine Plague]]. The epidemic, believed to be either [[smallpox]] or [[measles]], swept the Roman Empire during the reign of Marcus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Roman Empire: From Severus to Constantine| author=Patricia Southern| year=2001| p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*There is no indication Marcus Aurelius wished to return the Empire to a [[Roman Republic|Republican]] form of government, as depicted in the film. Moreover, he shared the rule of the Empire with Commodus for three years before his own death. Commodus then ruled alone from that point until his death at the end of 192 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Roman Emperors| author=Michael Grant| year=1985| p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The film depicts Marcus as defeating the barbarians in the [[Marcomannic Wars]]. In reality the war was still ongoing when Aurelius died; Commodus secured peace by a treaty with the two Germanic tribes allied against Rome, the [[Marcomanni]] and the [[Quadi]], immediately after his father's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Roman Empire: From Severus to Constantine| author=Patricia Southern| year=2001| p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The character of Maximus is fictional, although in some respects he resembles the historical figures [[Narcissus (wrestler)|Narcissus]] (Commodus's real-life murderer and the character's name in the first draft of the screenplay),&lt;ref name=&quot;exovedate&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Gladiator: The Real Story|url=http://www.exovedate.com/the_real_gladiator_one.html|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spartacus]] (who led a significant slave revolt in 73-71 BC), [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus|Cincinnatus]] (519-430 BC) (a farmer who was made [[Roman dictator|dictator]], saved Rome from invasion, then resigned his six-month appointment after 15 days),&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_c&quot;&gt;[[Livy]].

*Although Commodus engaged in show combat in the Colosseum, he was not killed in the arena; he was strangled in his bath by the wrestler Narcissus. Commodus reigned for over twelve years, unlike the shorter period portrayed in the film.&lt;ref name=RS&gt;{{cite web|title=GLADIATOR: THE REAL STORY|author=|url=http://www.exovedate.com/the_real_gladiator_one.html|publisher=|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;{{cite web|title=Commodus|author=|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9024967/Commodus|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the film, [[Lucilla]] is portrayed as a lone widow of [[Lucius Verus]] with one son, also named Lucius Verus. While Lucilla was the widow of Verus and also had a son by that name, their son died young, long before the reign of Commodus, and Lucilla remarried [[Claudius Pompeianus]] soon after Verus' death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peacock&quot;&gt;Peacock, Phoebe B., Library of Congress, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/lverus.htm Lucius Verus (161–169 A.D.)], roman-emperors.org. Accessed 2012-5-29.&lt;/ref&gt; She had been married to him for 11 years by the time her brother became Emperor. The film omits Lucilla's other two children with Verus, Lucilla Plautia and Aurelia Lucilla.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peacock&quot;&gt;Peacock, Phoebe B., Library of Congress, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/lverus.htm Lucius Verus (161–169 A.D.)], roman-emperors.org. Accessed 2012-5-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lucilla was implicated in a plot to assassinate her brother in 182 AD, along with her husband Pompeianus and several others. She was first exiled to the island of [[Capri]] by her brother, then executed on his orders later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Roman Emperors| author=Michael Grant| year=1985| p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The character of Maximus had a similar career (and personality traits as documented by [[Herodian]]) to [[Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus|Claudius Pompeianus]] (a [[Syria]]n) who married [[Marcus Aurelius]]' daughter [[Lucilla]] following the death of [[Lucius Verus]]. It is believed Aurelius may have wanted Pompeianus to succeed him as [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] in preference to Commodus but was turned down. Pompeianus had no part in any of the many plots against Commodus. He was not depicted in the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward&quot;/&gt;
*In the film the character Antonius Proximo claims &quot;the wise&quot; Marcus Aurelius banned gladiatorial games in Rome forcing him to move to [[Mauretania]]. The real Aurelius did ban the games, but only in [[Antioch]] as punishment for the city's support of the usurper [[Avidius Cassius]]. No games were ever banned in Rome. However, when the Emperor started conscripting gladiators into the legions, the resulting shortage in fighters allowed ''[[Gladiator#Schools_and_training|lanistae]]'' such as Proximo to make &quot;windfall&quot; profits through increased charges for their services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winkler&quot;/&gt;
*In real life, the death of Commodus did not result in a peace for Rome, nor a return to the Roman Republic. Rather, it ushered in a chaotic and bloody power struggle that culminated in the [[Year of the Five Emperors]] of AD 193. According to Herodian, the people of Rome were overjoyed at the news of Commodus dying, although they feared that the praetorians would not accept the new emperor [[Pertinax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Echols|first1=Edward|title=Herodian 2.2 - Livius|url=http://www.livius.org/sources/content/herodian-s-roman-history/herodian-2.2/|website=Livius, Articles on ancient history|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anachronisms===
Costumes within the film are almost never completely historically correct. Some of the soldiers wear [[Galea (helmet)|fantasy helmets]]. The bands wrapped around their lower arms were rarely ever worn. Their appearance is the product of historical movies always depicting peoples of antiquity wearing such bands. Although the film is set within the 2nd century AD, the [[Lorica segmentata|Imperial Gallic armor]] and the [[Imperial helmet#Imperial Gallic|helmets]] worn by the legionaries are from AD 75, a century earlier. This was superseded by [[Imperial helmet#Imperial Italic|new design]]s in AD 100. Likewise the legions' [[Aquilifer|standard bearers (Aquilifer)]], [[centurion]]s, [[Roman cavalry|mounted forces]], and [[auxilia]]ries would have worn scale armour, [[lorica squamata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Kelly &amp; Robert Douglas Smith|last=DeVries|title=Medieval Weapons: An Illustrated History of Their Impact|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2007|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jdcrsCOB-VcC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Lorica%20squamata&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q=Lorica%20squamata&amp;f=false 24–27]|isbn=9781851095261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rubens.anu.edu.au/raid1/student_projects97/armour/scale/scale.html|title=Scale (Lorica Squamata)|publisher=[[Australian National University]]|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germanic tribes are dressed in clothes from the Stone Age period.&lt;ref&gt;Junkelmann, Marcus in ''Hollywoods Traum von Rom'' (Hollywood’s Dream of Rome), p. 117, 120 and 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman cavalry]] are shown attacking using [[stirrup]]s. This is anachronistic in that the horse-mounted forces of the [[Roman army]] used a two-horned saddle. Stirrups were only employed for safety reasons because of the additional training and skill required to ride with a Roman saddle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winkler&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Winkler | first = Martin M. | year = 2004 | title = Gladiator: film and history | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location =  | isbn = 1-4051-1042-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Movie Nitpick: Gladiator|url=http://www.nitpickers.com/movies/nitpick.cgi?np=16281|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040107011248/http://www.nitpickers.com/movies/nitpick.cgi?np=16281|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2004-01-07|publisher=The Nitpickers Site|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catapult]]s and [[ballista]]e would not have been used in a forest. They were reserved primarily for [[siege]]s and were rarely used in open battles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winkler&quot;/&gt;

The Praetorian Guards seen in the film are all wearing black uniforms. No historical evidence supports that. On campaign they usually wore standard legionary equipment albeit with some unique decorative elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Praetorian Guard (Elite)|last=Rankov|first=Boris|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the bird's eye view of Rome when the city is introduced for the first time there are several buildings that did not exist at the time of ''Gladiator''. For example, the [[Basilica of Maxentius|Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine]] is quite prominent; however, it was not completed until AD 312.

==Influences==
The film's plot was influenced by two 1960s [[Hollywood]] films of the [[Peplum film genre|sword-and-sandal]] genre, ''[[The Fall of the Roman Empire (film)|The Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' and ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Scholia Reviews ns 14 (2005) 11.|author=Martin M. Winkler|url=http://www.classics.und.ac.za/reviews/05-11win.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040825235238/http://www.classics.und.ac.za/reviews/05-11win.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=August 25, 2004|publisher=|date=June 23, 2002|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shares several plot points with ''The Fall of the Roman Empire'', which tells the story of Livius, who, like Maximus in ''Gladiator,'' is Marcus Aurelius's intended successor. Livius is in love with Lucilla and seeks to marry her while Maximus, who is happily married, was formerly in love with her. Both films portray the death of Marcus Aurelius as an assassination. In ''Fall of the Roman Empire'' a group of conspirators independent of Commodus, hoping to profit from Commodus's accession, arrange for Marcus Aurelius to be poisoned; in ''Gladiator'' Commodus himself murders his father by smothering him. In the course of ''Fall of the Roman Empire'' Commodus unsuccessfully seeks to win Livius over to his vision of empire in contrast to that of his father, but continues to employ him notwithstanding; in ''Gladiator'', when Commodus fails to secure Maximus's allegiance, he executes Maximus's wife and son and tries unsuccessfully to execute him. Livius in ''Fall of the Roman Empire'' and Maximus in ''Gladiator'' kill Commodus in single combat, Livius to save Lucilla and Maximus to avenge the murder of his wife and son, and both do it for the greater good of Rome.

Scott cited ''Spartacus'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' as influences on the film: &quot;These movies were part of my cinema-going youth. But at the dawn of the new millennium, I thought this might be the ideal time to revisit what may have been the most important period of the last two thousand years&amp;nbsp;– if not all recorded history&amp;nbsp;– the apex and beginning of the decline of the greatest military and political power the world has ever known.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Landau 28&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|2000|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Spartacus'' provides the film's gladiatorial motif, as well as the character of Senator Gracchus, a fictitious senator (bearing the name of a [[Gracchi|pair of revolutionary]] [[Tribune]]s from the 2nd century BC) who in both films is an elder statesman of [[ancient Rome]] attempting to preserve the ancient rights of the Roman Senate in the face of an ambitious [[Autocracy|autocrat]]&amp;nbsp;–[[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] in ''Spartacus'' and Commodus in ''Gladiator.'' Both actors who played Gracchus (in ''Spartacus'' and ''Gladiator''), played [[Claudius]] in previous films&amp;nbsp;– [[Charles Laughton]] of ''Spartacus'' played Claudius in the unfinished 1937 film ''[[I, Claudius (film)|I, Claudius]]'' and Sir [[Derek Jacobi]] of ''Gladiator'', played Claudius in [[I, Claudius (TV series)|the 1976 BBC adaptation]]. Both films also share a specific set piece, wherein a gladiator (Maximus here, [[Woody Strode]]'s Draba in ''Spartacus'') throws his weapon into a spectator box at the end of a match, as well as at least one line of dialogue: &quot;Rome is the mob&quot;, said here by Gracchus and by [[Julius Caesar]] ([[John Gavin]]) in ''Spartacus''.

The film's depiction of Commodus's entry into Rome borrows imagery from [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s [[Nazism|Nazi]] propaganda film ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' (1935), although Scott has pointed out that the [[iconography]] of Nazi rallies was itself inspired by the Roman Empire. ''Gladiator'' reflects back on the film by duplicating similar events that occurred in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s procession. The Nazi film opens with an aerial view of Hitler arriving in a plane, while Scott shows an aerial view of Rome, quickly followed by a shot of the large crowd of people watching Commodus pass them in a procession with his [[chariot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Winkler p114&quot;&gt;Winkler, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; The first thing to appear in ''Triumph of the Will'' is a Nazi eagle, which is alluded to when a statue of an eagle sits atop one of the arches (and then is shortly followed by several more decorative eagles throughout the rest of the scene) leading up to the procession of Commodus. At one point in the Nazi film, a little girl gives flowers to Hitler, while Commodus is met by several girls who all give him bundles of flowers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winkler p115&quot;&gt;Winkler, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oscar-nominated score was composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[Lisa Gerrard]], and conducted by [[Gavin Greenaway]]. Zimmer was originally planning to use Israeli vocalist [[Ofra Haza]] for the score, after his work with her in ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]''. However, Haza died in late February 2000, before she was able to record, and so Gerrard was chosen instead.

===Accolades===
{{Main|List of accolades received by Gladiator}}
''Gladiator'' was nominated in 36 individual ceremonies, including the [[73rd Academy Awards]], the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA Awards]], and the [[Golden Globe Awards]]. Of 119 award nominations, the film won 48 prizes.&lt;ref name=&quot;awards&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172495/awards|title=Gladiator awards tally|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film won five Academy Awards and was nominated for an additional seven, including [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Joaquin Phoenix]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Ridley Scott. It was the first movie to win Best Picture without winning either a directing or screenwriting award since ''[[All the King's Men (1949 film)|All the King's Men]]'' at the [[22nd Academy Awards]] in 1950. In [[75th Academy Awards|2003]], ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' became another Best Picture winner which didn't win an Academy Award in either of these two major categories. Due to [[Academy Awards|Academy]] rules, only [[Hans Zimmer]] was officially nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and not to [[Lisa Gerrard]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/gladiator.html| title=Filmtracks: Gladiator (Hans Zimmer/Lisa Gerrard)| newspaper=Filmtracks.com| date= May 5, 2000| author=| accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the pair did win the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]] as co-composers.

==Impact==
The film's mainstream success is responsible for an increased interest in Roman and classical history in the United States. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', this has been dubbed the &quot;Gladiator Effect&quot;.

{{quote|It's called ''the 'Gladiator' effect'' by writers and publishers. The snob in us likes to believe that it is always books that spin off movies. Yet in this case, it's the movies&amp;nbsp;– most recently ''Gladiator'' two years ago&amp;nbsp;– that have created the interest in the ancients. And not for more Roman screen colossals, but for writing that is serious or fun or both.&quot;&lt;ref name=nytg/&gt;}}

The [[Cicero]] biography ''Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician'' and Gregory Hays's translation of [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s ''[[Meditations]]'' received large spikes in sales after the release of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytg&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Martin|first=Arnold|title=Making Books; Book Parties With Togas|publisher=The New York Times|date=July 11, 2002|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2D61530F932A25754C0A9649C8B63|accessdate=February 27, 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080117055645/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2D61530F932A25754C0A9649C8B63 |archivedate = January 17, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also began a revival of the historical epic genre with films such as ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'', ''[[The Alamo (2004 film)|The Alamo]]'', ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'', ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'', ''[[300 (film)|300]]'', ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' and ''[[Robin Hood (2010 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (the last two were also directed by Scott).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2004&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=The 15 Most Influential Films of Our Lifetime|publisher=''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''|page=115|date=June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of Maximus was placed 12th in the ''[[Total Film]]'' list of 50 best movie heroes and villains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/entertainment/the-50-greatest-movie-heroes-and-baddies-of-all-time-revealed_1006810.html |title=The 50 greatest movie heroes and baddies of all time revealed |publisher=Thaindian.com |date=2007-11-27 |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 35th in the [[Empire (film magazine)|''Empire'']]'s 100 Greatest Movie Characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empireonline.com/100-greatest-movie-characters/default.asp?c=35 The 100 Greatest Movie Characters] ''Empire''&lt;/ref&gt; Maximus is also featured on 55[[Cent (currency)|c]] &quot;Australian Legends&quot; postage stamp series.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7867661.stm|format=|title= Oscar winning Aussies go postal|publisher = BBC News|author= |accessdate=2010-01-13 | date=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell Crowe attended a ceremony to mark the creation of the stamps.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt;

==Home media==
The film was first released on [[DVD]] on November 21, 2000, and has since been released in several different extended and special edition versions. Special features for the [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray Disc]] and DVDs include [[deleted scene]]s, [[trailer (promotion)|trailers]], [[Documentary film|documentaries]], [[Audio commentary|commentaries]], [[storyboard]]s, image galleries, [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]], and [[audition|cast auditions]]. The film was released on Blu-ray in September 2009, in a 2-disc edition containing both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film, as part of Paramount's &quot;Sapphire Series&quot; (Paramount bought the DreamWorks library in 2006).&lt;ref name=&quot;blu-ray&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/movies.php?id=4735|title=Gladiator|publisher=Blu-ray.com|accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial reviews of the Blu-ray Disc release criticized poor image quality, leading many to call for it to be remastered, as Sony did with ''[[The Fifth Element]]'' in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;bigscreen&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bigscreen.com/journal.php?id=1632|title=Initial &quot;Gladiator&quot; Blu-ray Reviews Report Picture Quality Issues|publisher=Netflix|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A remastered version was later released in 2010.

The DVD editions that have been released since the original two-disc version, include a film only single-disc edition as well as a three-disc &quot;extended edition&quot; DVD which was released in August 2005. The extended edition DVD features approximately fifteen minutes of additional scenes, most of which appear in the previous release as deleted scenes. The original cut, which Scott still calls his director's cut, is also select-able via [[seamless branching]] (which is not included on the UK edition). The DVD is also notable for having a new commentary track featuring director Scott and star Crowe. The film is on the first disc, the second one has a three-hour documentary into the making of the film by DVD producer [[Charles de Lauzirika]], and the third disc contains supplements. Discs one and two of the three-disc extended edition were also repackaged and sold as a two-disc &quot;special edition&quot; in the EU in 2005. The film will be released on 4K UHD on May 15 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Paramount/Disc_Announcements/braveheart-and-gladiator-4k-uhd-blurays-detailed-updated/41033|title='Braveheart' and 'Gladiator' 4K UHD Blu-rays Detailed (UPDATED) {{!}} High-Def Digest|website=www.highdefdigest.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible sequel==
In June 2001, [[Douglas Wick]] said a ''Gladiator'' [[prequel]] was in development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stax2001&quot;&gt;{{Citation|author=Stax|title=IGN FilmForce Exclusive: David Franzoni in Negotiations for Another Gladiator!|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 16, 2001|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/300/300625p1.html|accessdate=February 27, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226104104/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/300/300625p1.html|archivedate=February 26, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Wick, [[Walter Parkes]], [[David Franzoni]], and [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]] switched direction to a sequel set fifteen years later;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brian2002&quot;&gt;{{Citation|author=Brian Linder|title=A Hero Will Rise...

This includes a suggestion by Parkes that, in order to enable Russell Crowe to return to play Maximus, who dies at the end of the original movie, a sequel could involve a &quot;multi-generational drama about Maximus and the Aureleans and this chapter of Rome&quot;, similar in concept to ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''.

In 2006, Scott stated he and Crowe approached [[Nick Cave]] to rewrite the film, but their ideas conflicted with DreamWorks's idea of a spin-off involving Lucius, whom Scott revealed would turn out to be Maximus's son with Lucilla. Scott noted that a tale of corruption in Rome was too complex, whereas ''Gladiator'' worked due to its simple drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1646784/ridley_lays_quotgladiator_2quot_to_rest/| title=Ridley Lays &quot;Gladiator 2&quot; to Rest - Rotten Tomatoes| newspaper=Rottentomatoes| date=May 8, 2006 | author= Scott Weinberg | accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, details of Cave's ultimately-rejected script surfaced on the internet: the script having Maximus being reincarnated by the Roman gods and returned to Rome to defend Christians against persecution; then transported to other important periods in history, including [[World War II]], the [[Vietnam War]], and finally being a general in the modern-day [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]]. This script for a sequel, however, was rejected as being too far-fetched, and not in keeping with the spirit and theme of the original film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michaels2009&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/06/nick-cave-rejected-gladiator-script | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Nick Cave's rejected Gladiator 2 script uncovered! | first=Sean | last=Michaels | date=May 6, 2009 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cave&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last=Cave | first=Nick | title=Gladiator 2 Draft | url=http://www.mypdfscripts.com/unproduced/gladiator-2-by-nick-cave | accessdate=16 May 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225095848/http://www.mypdfscripts.com/unproduced/gladiator-2-by-nick-cave | archivedate=25 February 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, Scott again stated that he has an idea of how a sequel could be done, and that he is currently trying to convince Russell Crowe to reprise his role as Maximus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/03/10/ridley-scott-gladiator-sequel/?preview_id=5594789|title=Ridley Scott On 'Gladiator' Sequel: 'I Know How to Bring Him Back'|date=11 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2693">'''The Yellow Dwarf''' is a French literary [[fairy tale]] by [[Madame d'Aulnoy]].  [[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Blue Fairy Book]]''.

==Synopsis==

A widowed queen spoiled her only daughter, who was so beautiful that kings vied for the honor of her hand, not believing they could attain it.  Uneasy that her daughter would never marry, the queen went to visit the [[Fairy]] of the Desert for advice.  She made a cake to protect herself from the lions that guarded the fairy, but she lost it.  A yellow [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] offered to save her in return for her daughter's hand.  She accepted, but when the dwarf showed the miserable home in which her daughter would live, she grew quite ill.  

Her daughter, distressed, went to seek the same fairy.  The dwarf told her what her mother had promised, and when she was ready to reject it, the lions arrived.  She agreed if he would save her.  Back at the castle, she fell quite ill and agreed to marry the King of the Gold Mines.  However, at the wedding, the Fairy of the Desert and the Yellow Dwarf interrupted.  The dwarf carried off the princess, and the fairy fell in love with the king and carried him off.  She chained him in a cave and turned herself into a beautiful woman, but her feet being unchanged, the king was able to tell who she was.  He told her that he would hate the fairy as long as she kept him chained up, but would love her if she freed him.  The Fairy of the Desert freed him and brought him to her castle, carrying him by the castle where the princess lived; she saw them and became convinced that the king was unfaithful to her.  

The king was kept more pleasantly, but was unable to escape.  He lamented his fate along the sea, and a [[mermaid]] left enchanted sea rushes behind to look like his body and freed him.  She gave him a sword to fight his way to the princess.  

The fairy was entirely deceived by the sea rushes and did not pursue him.

The king fought his way through [[sphinx]]es and [[dragon]]s to find his path blocked by maidens with garlands of flowers; he still pressed on, tearing apart their garlands, and reached the princess.  He persuaded her of his fidelity, but the Yellow Dwarf found them and killed him.  The princess died of grief.

The mermaid was only able to change their bodies to two palm trees.

&quot;'''You Win or You Die'''&quot; is the seventh episode of the [[HBO]] [[medieval fantasy]] television series ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. It was written by [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]], and directed by [[Daniel Minahan]]. Set to air May 29, 2011, the episode was released in advance immediately following the conclusion of &quot;[[A Golden Crown]]&quot; to HBO customers with access to [[HBO Go]].

The episode furthers the story line of deterioration of the political balance of the Seven Kingdoms, with Eddard Stark revealing what he has discovered to Cersei Lannister while King Robert is still away on a hunt. The title of the episode is part of a quote from Cersei Lannister during the final confrontation with Eddard: &quot;When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.&quot; The catchphrase has been frequently used during the promotion of both the books and the television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2011/03/10/game-of-thrones-poster/|title='Game Of Thrones' First Official Poster Reminds You That In War, You Win Or You Die|work=MTV Movies Blog|first=Terri|last=Schwartz|accessdate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was generally well received by critics for its well-acted dramatic tension, but with several criticizing the coupling of exposition and nudity as &quot;[[sexposition]]&quot;. In the United States, the episode [[Nielsen ratings|achieved a viewership]] of 2.4 million in its initial broadcast.

This episode marks the final appearance of [[Mark Addy]].

==Plot==
Like previous episodes, &quot;You Win or You Die&quot; interweaves action happening in multiple separate locations within and around the Kingdom of [[Westeros]]. While the dramatic center of this episode is in the capital of King's Landing, where the title quote is issued, ongoing events at The Wall and Winterfell in the north and with the Dothraki across the Narrow Sea continue, and events at the Lannister army's camp are depicted as well.

===At the Lannister camp===
Lord Tywin Lannister talks with his son Jaime while the former is skinning a stag, symbolic animal of the house Baratheon. While Tywin chastises Jaime for causing the recent troubles with the Starks, he nevertheless believes this war is the perfect opportunity for the Lannisters to set up a dynasty as the new rulers of the Seven Kingdoms. Tywin gives half of his forces to Jaime to attack Riverrun, the seat of House Tully and Lady Catelyn's childhood home, in retaliation for Catelyn's seizure of Tyrion.

===At Winterfell===
The captured wildling Osha, now a servant of the Starks, is harassed by Theon Greyjoy, who warns her that if she had been arrested in his homeland the Iron Islands, she would have suffered a worse fate. As Maester Luwin tells Theon to leave her alone after witnessing Theon's sexual advance on her, he asks Osha why she and other wildlings are coming south from the Wall. She reveals they were fleeing from the White Walkers, who have apparently returned after millennia of slumber, and declares that every army in the Seven Kingdoms should be marching north to confront that threat.

===At the Wall===
Benjen Stark's horse returns from north of the Wall without him, much to the worry of his nephew, Jon Snow. Later, to Jon's disappointment and anger, he is told he has been assigned as a steward to the Lord Commander instead of a ranger, like his uncle. Jon suspects Ser Alliser Thorne's involvement, as revenge for Jon defying him; however, Sam believes that this assignment may mean he is being groomed for command. As Jon and Sam take their vows near a heart tree, Jon's direwolf brings him a dismembered hand.

===In Vaes Dothrak===
Daenerys Targaryen attempts to convince Khal Drogo to return to her homeland and reclaim the throne of the Seven Kingdoms, but he is not interested. While Daenerys and her entourage go sightseeing at a market, Ser Jorah Mormont receives a pardon for him to return to the Seven Kingdoms from an informant of Lord Varys. Jorah realizes this means the order to assassinate Daenerys has been officially issued and quickly saves her from a wine merchant who tries to poison her. Drogo, angered by the attempt on his wife's life, vows to his followers that he will lead his people to cross the Narrow Sea to invade the Seven Kingdoms as revenge and reclaim the [[Iron Throne (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Iron Throne]] for his unborn son.

===In King's Landing===
Ned confronts Queen Cersei, telling her that he knows Prince Joffrey and his siblings are not King Robert's children, but were incestuously fathered by her brother Jaime. Cersei defends her affair with Jaime, comparing it to the ancient Targaryen practice of wedding brothers to sisters and saying she tried to love Robert, but he refused to love her because he was still in love with Ned's deceased sister, Lyanna. Ned shows Cersei mercy and tells her to leave the capital with her children before he tells Robert the truth.

Unexpectedly, Lord Renly Baratheon returns and informs Ned that, while hunting, Robert was mortally wounded by a boar. On his deathbed, Robert dictates his [[Will and testament|will]] to Ned, in which Robert makes Ned the Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm until Joffrey comes of age. Ned writes down Robert's words, but instead of using &quot;Joffrey,&quot; Ned writes &quot;my rightful heir,&quot; making the succession ambiguous. Robert signs the will without reading this change in wording and begs Ned to make Joffrey a better man. Robert also tells Ned that he was wrong to have ordered Daenerys Targaryen's assassination and orders Ned to let her live.

Fearing Cersei and the Lannisters will use this time to their advantage, Renly tries to convince Ned they should raise an army and launch a [[coup d'état]]; however, Ned refuses him. Ned wants to ensure that the crown passes to the rightful heir: Stannis Baratheon, Robert and Renly's brother. Ned writes a letter to Stannis informing him of the situation, dispatching it to Dragonstone, Stannis' island fortress. Ned also reveals to Petyr &quot;Littlefinger&quot; Baelish the truth of Joffrey's heritage, to which Littlefinger suggests they allow Joffrey and the Lannisters to take the throne, and if Joffrey proves to be an unfit ruler, they can use the truth to overthrow him and make Renly the king instead. Ned refuses such treason, asking Littlefinger to secure the support of the City Watch to overpower Cersei's men-at-arms if they attempt to seize the throne.

By the time Robert dies, Renly has fled the capital, and Joffrey has already ordered his own [[coronation]] within a [[fortnight]]. As Ned and his allies enter the throne room, he gives Ser Barristan Selmy Robert's will to read out aloud. Cersei refuses to follow Robert's will and tears it up, ordering Barristan to seize Ned. Ned orders his men to arrest Cersei and Joffrey. As both sides prepare to fight, the City Watch slaughters the Stark men while Littlefinger holds Ned with a knife at his throat, telling Ned that he should have listened to Littlefinger's advice about distrusting him.

==Production==

===Writing===
[[File:D. B. Weiss and David Benioff.jpg|right|thumb|The episode was written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.]]
The episode was written by the showrunners [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]], based on [[A Game of Thrones|the original novel]] by [[George R. R. Martin]]. The chapters included in &quot;You Win or You Die&quot; are 46, 48-50, and 55 (Eddard XII, Eddard XIII, Jon VI, Eddard XIV, and Daenerys VI), making it the episode that includes fewest chapters of the source novel in the entire first season.&lt;ref name=&quot;suvudu&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sf-fantasy.suvudu.com/2011/05/game-of-thrones-you-win-or-you-die.html|title=Game of Thrones: You Win or You Die|work=Suvudu|last=Garcia|first=Elio|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Westeros.org&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.westeros.org/GoT/Episodes/Entry/You_Win_or_You_Die/Book_Spoilers/#Book_to_Screen|title=EP107: You Win or You Die|last=Garcia|first=Elio|last2=Antonsson|first2=Linda|work=Westeros.org|date=March 31, 2012|accessdate=November 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the scenes created specifically for the show were a meeting between Tywin and Jaime Lannister (as Lord Tywin is field dressing a stag) and a &quot;training&quot; session between Littlefinger and two new female recruits for one of his brothels.&lt;ref name=&quot;av1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/you-win-or-you-die-for-experts,56747/|title=You Win or You Die (For Experts)|last=VanDerWerff|first=Todd|work=A.V. Club|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
&quot;You Win or You Die&quot; marks the first appearance of [[Charles Dance]] as Lord Tywin, the patriarch of the Lannister household. Cast in the role shortly after the production began, Dance had been the first choice of the producers and one of the fan favorites for the role. Author George R. R. Martin commented that &quot;his commanding screen presence and steely charisma should make him the perfect Lord Tywin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grrm.livejournal.com/172730.html |title=Three More for the Show |last=Martin |first=George R.R. |work=Not a Blog |accessdate=May 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721221006/http://grrm.livejournal.com/172730.html |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deer that is field dressed by Tywin in the opening scene was a real dead stag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/#/game-of-thrones/episodes/1/07-you-win-or-you-die/video/inside-the-episode.html|title=Inside the Episode: You Win or You Die|work=HBO|accessdate=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dance had no previous experience with skinning and gutting, and before filming the scene practiced for an hour with a butcher.

===Filming locations===
Most of the episode was shot on set at the Irish studios of [[The Paint Hall]]. The exteriors of the entrance of Vaes Dothrak were filmed in the Sandy Brae area,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/tag/bryan-cogman?currentPage=3|title=Dispatches From The Seven Kingdoms: Swarming Horde|date=August 5, 2010|accessdate=January 14, 2012|last=Cogman|first=Bryan|work=makinggameofthrones.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315234152/http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/tag/bryan-cogman?currentPage=3|archivedate=March 15, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the confrontation between Eddard and Cersei taking place in the Red Keep's gardens (identified as a godswood in the novels) the production used the cloister of the St Dominic Monastery in [[Rabat, Malta|Rabat]], in Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://winter-is-coming.net/2010/11/more-on-malta/ |title=More on Malta |work=Winter is Coming.net |accessdate=May 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212095341/http://winter-is-coming.net/2010/11/more-on-malta/ |archivedate=December 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Ratings===
&quot;You Win or You Die&quot;'s first airing was seen by 2.4&amp;nbsp;million viewers, stabilizing the show's ratings. This could be considered positive when taking into account that the episode had been offered in advance during the preceding week in HBO's online service, and that it was aired in a three-day holiday weekend which often results in lower viewership. With the second airing, the total audience for the night was 3.2&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/06/01/game-of-thrones-episode-seven-ratings/|title='Game of Thrones' episode seven ratings are in|work=Enterntainment Weekly|first=James|last=Hibberd|accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
The episode was well received by critics. ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]''{{'}}s reviewer [[James Poniewozik]] called &quot;You Win or You Die&quot; the &quot;most thrilling and thematically rich hour to date,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2011/05/30/game-of-thrones-watch-boared-to-death/|title=Game of Thrones Watch: Boared to Death|work=Time|first=James|last=Poniewozik|accessdate=June 3, 2011|date=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AOL TV]]'s Maureen Ryan found it an excellent outing that &quot;saw the stakes raised in satisfying and suspenseful ways,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;aol&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/05/29/game-of-thrones-season-1-episode-7-recap/ |title='Game of Thrones' Season 1, Episode 7 Recap |work=TV Squad |first=Maureen |last=Ryan |accessdate=June 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502120407/http://www.aoltv.com/2011/05/29/game-of-thrones-season-1-episode-7-recap/ |archivedate=May 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[HitFix]]'s [[Alan Sepinwall]] called it a terrific episode and commended how &quot;it turned the spotlight on the characters who are villains in Ned Stark's version of the story.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hitfix&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/game-of-thrones-you-win-or-you-die-the-boar-war|title=Review: 'Game of Thrones' - 'You Win or You Die': The boar war|work=HitFix|first=Alan|last=Sepinwall|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote = &quot;The titular game of thrones (which gets namechecked in the line from Cersei that also provides the individual episode name) has moved past the opening gambit stage now. Major players are falling, alliances are being made and broken, and based on what we know is happening in the north with the White Walkers and to the east with the Dothraki, the game is bound to get a lot bloodier in a damn hurry. These people don't have time to be stressing about who sits on the Iron Throne, not when giant zombies and/or relentless master warriors are on their way.&quot;
|salign = right

}}

Poniewozik continued: &quot;We knew this would be a significant episode if for no other reason than that it contains the scene—alluded to in the episode's title—that gives the series its name,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;/&gt; a sentiment Sepinwall agreed with. Myles McNutt, writing for Cultural Learnings, also considered &quot;You Win or You Die&quot; a climactic moment in the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;cultural&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cultural-learnings.com/2011/05/29/game-of-thrones-you-win-or-you-die/|title=Game of Thrones – &quot;You Win or You Die&quot;|work=Cultural Learnings|first=Myles|last=McNutt|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[IGN]]'s Matt Fowler noted that this was the episode that saw Ned Stark &quot;unfortunately thwarted by his own honorable intentions,&quot; but that his &quot;stubborn nobility is what makes Ned such a great character.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/116/1169872p1.html|title=Game of Thrones: &quot;You Win or You Die&quot; Review|work=IGN|first=Matt|last=Fowler|accessdate=May 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final showdown with the Lannisters seizing control from Eddard was much discussed, with many commentators criticizing Ned's ingenuity and his actions during the episode. In ''[[The Atlantic]]'', Scott Meslow wrote that Eddard could never win the &quot;game of thrones&quot; because he is dedicated to playing by the rules. In his opinion, &quot;one can't afford to play fair&quot; when the only outcomes are &quot;win&quot; or &quot;die.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantic&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/05/game-of-thrones-cheaters-always-win/239608/|title='Game of Thrones': Cheaters Always Win|work=The Atlantic|first=Scott|last=Meslow|accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; McNutt felt that the climax at the episode's end &quot;was really well handled by both the cast and the director (Dan Minahan).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cultural&quot;/&gt;

As well as the final confrontation between Eddard and Cersei, other scenes were praised by the critics. The introduction of [[Charles Dance]] as Lord Tywin Lannister was considered &quot;a beauty&quot; by Todd VanDerWerff from ''[[the A.V. Club]]'', who admired how a single scene depicted not only the relationship between Tywin and Jaime, but also all the dynamics of the Lannister clan. He also praised the work of [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] in the scene, commenting that despite having few lines, he transmitted that Jaime is cowed by his father very well.&lt;ref name=&quot;av1&quot;/&gt; Maureen Ryan agreed with that sentiment, and also lauded [[Natalia Tena]]'s short appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;aol&quot;/&gt; David Sims (a second reviewer for ''the A.V. Club'') highlighted the work of Mark Addy in his final scene, extending the praise to the rest of his work on the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;av2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/you-win-or-you-die-for-newbies,56748/|title=&quot;You Win Or You Die&quot; (for newbies)|work=A.V. Club|first=David|last=Sims|accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics agreed that the scenes with the Dothraki were strong, with the storyline having improved significantly since the first episodes. Poniewozik stated that &quot;this was the first week for me that the Dothraki scenes were not just absorbing but felt like the characters were as well-imagined as those in Westeros,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;/&gt; and McNutt felt the episode &quot;finally allows Khal Drogo to become an actual character.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cultural&quot;/&gt; Drogo's rant vowing to give his unborn son the Iron Throne led to compliments about [[Jason Momoa]]'s intensity and [[Emilia Clarke]]'s calm and loving facial expressions.&lt;ref name=&quot;av1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aol&quot;/&gt;

However, the scene where Littlefinger exposes his motivations while hiring two whores for his brothel was largely criticized as an example of the show's perceived abuse of conversations with prostitutes as an expository device, a situation for which Myles McNutt coined the term &quot;[[sexposition]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cultural&quot;/&gt; Aidan Gillen's acting was consistently praised and the comparison between Littlefinger's actions and faking an orgasm was considered apt, but many agreed with Meslow's statement that it was &quot;annoyingly overshadowed by the series' most gratuitous sex scene to date.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantic&quot;/&gt; Among other criticisms were the scene's excessive length, the repetition of the dramatic approach, and the assumption that viewers were not going to pay attention when presented with a long exposition that did not include sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;av2&quot;/&gt;

'''Robert Baratheon''' is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series of [[fantasy]] novels by American author [[George R. R. Martin]], and its television adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

Introduced in 1996's ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'', Robert Baratheon is the eldest son of [[Steffon Baratheon]], from the kingdom of [[Westeros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/guide/houses/jbaratheon/robert-baratheon/|title=Game of Thrones Viewer's Guide|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Robert won the rebellion which was named after him, he took the [[Iron Throne (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Iron Throne]] from his distant cousin Aerys II Targaryen, nicknamed &quot;The Mad King&quot;, crushing the Targaryen dynasty. Robert fought the war to win back his betrothed, [[Lyanna Stark]], with the aid of her brother, his close friend, [[Ned Stark|Eddard Stark]]. However, due to Lyanna's death, Robert married [[Tywin Lannister]]'s daughter [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] after the war ended to ensure political stability.

Robert is portrayed by [[Mark Addy]] in the [[HBO]] television adaptation.&lt;ref name=HBOCast&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html#/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/robert-baratheon/bio/robert-baratheon.html |title=''Game of Thrones'' Cast and Crew: Robert Baratheon played by Mark Addy |publisher=[[HBO]] | accessdate=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html#/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/index.html|title=The Official Website for the HBO Series Game of Thrones - Season 4|work=HBO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grrm.livejournal.com/164794.html |title=From HBO |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307150640/http://grrm.livejournal.com/164794.html |archivedate=2016-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character description ==
Robert is in his mid-thirties when the events of the books begin. He is jovial and fun-loving, fond of battle, women and drink. As a young man Robert was a formidable warrior, noted for his chivalry, sense of honor and immense charisma. He won several loyal Targaryen bannermen to his cause through strength of personality alone. Very tall and incredibly muscular, Robert was considered one of the most attractive men in Westeros, desired by every maiden in the realm, being described in ''A Game of Thrones'' as &quot;Muscled like a maiden's fantasy.&quot; However, after becoming king, Robert let himself go somewhat, becoming fat, soft and indolent, though still capable of great generosity to his friends. Robert has also become more bitter following Lyanna's death and his unhappy marriage to Cersei, despite their multiple children.

== Overview ==
Robert Baratheon is not a [[Narration#Third-person|point of view]] character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, such as [[Ned Stark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/map/special/areas-of-control/4/|title=Game of Thrones Viewer's Guide|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storylines ==
[[File:A Song of Ice and Fire arms of House Baratheon yellow scroll English.png|upright|thumb|alt=A coat of arms showing a black stag on a yellow field.|Coat of arms of House Baratheon]]

===In the books===
Robert Baratheon is King of the Seven Kingdoms at the beginning of ''A Game of Thrones''. He was the ward of [[Jon Arryn]] and was raised at [[the Eyrie]] alongside [[Eddard Stark]]. Fifteen years before the novels, Robert was betrothed to Ned's sister [[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]], and after Lyanna and [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] disappeared, Robert killed Rhaegar and seized the throne. He then married [[Cersei Lannister]] to ensure [[House Lannister]]'s support for his rule, but remained attached to the memory of Lyanna, which estranged Cersei.

At the beginning of ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'' Robert, then king, has just come to [[Winterfell]] to appoint [[Eddard Stark]] the Hand of The King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tor.com/2011/04/01/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-3/|title=A Read of Ice and Fire: A Game of Thrones, Part 3|work=Tor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was unaware that Cersei's three children were therefore fathered by her brother [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. More interested in food, drink, and [[tourney]]s than in governance, Robert has squandered the royal treasury, leaving the crown heavily in debt. After he dies in a hunting accident orchestrated by Cersei, the kingdoms plunge into civil war. His death incites the war that encompasses the entirety of the following two books, the War of the Five Kings, in which his two brothers, Lords [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] and [[Stannis Baratheon]], declare themselves the rightful kings. [[Robb Stark]] is also declared King in the North and King of the Trident, and Lord [[Balon Greyjoy]] declares himself King of the Iron Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tor.com/2011/09/09/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-game-of-thrones-part-23/|title=A Read of Ice and Fire: A Game of Thrones, Part 23|work=Tor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the show===
Robert Baratheon, formerly a fierce warrior, became [[Monarch|King]] of the Seven Kingdoms after leading a rebellion against Aerys II Targaryen. He was betrothed to Ned Stark's sister Lyanna and loved her deeply, but she loved Rhaegar Targaryen and married him in secret before they fled. Robert assumed Lyanna was abducted, beginning his revolt with Ned Stark after his father and brother were killed in King's Landing while trying to reclaim Lyanna. The event, known as Robert's Rebellion, resulted with the Targaryens mostly slaughtered or routed from the Kingdoms. Since Robert's family had closer ties to the former Royal family, this put Robert on the Iron Throne. Now, Robert has grown fat and miserable; he has no more wars to fight, is surrounded by plotters and sycophants, hates and is bored by the constant work needed to manage the Kingdoms properly, and trapped in a political marriage to the scheming Cersei Lannister, whom he has never loved. He is unaware that none of his three children are his, but instead Jaime Lannister's. Under his reign, the realm has been bankrupted, and Robert is deeply in debt to his wife's family. Killed while hunting, he unknowingly leaves no rightful heir behind. His bastards are ordered dead by Joffrey, many of which are killed, and Gendry is subsequently forced to flee the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/gallery/game-thrones-gruesome-deaths-robert-564263/1-robert-baratheon|title='Game of Thrones'' Gruesome Deaths: From Robert Baratheon to Jon Snow|author=Josh Wigler|date=7 June 2013|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In seasons six and seven, [[Bran Stark]]'s gift of vision as the Three-Eyed Raven revealed to him the truth of Rhaegar and Lyanna's relationship and that Robert's Rebellion was built on a lie.

'''Joffrey Baratheon''' is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series of [[epic fantasy]] novels by American author [[George R. R. Martin]], and its television adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/king-joffrey-jack-gleeson-retires-from-acting-after-game-of-thrones-season-4-9258777.html|title=King Joffrey: Jack Gleeson to retire from acting after Game of Thrones|author=Christopher Hooton|date=16 April 2014|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduced in 1996's ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'', Joffrey is the eldest son of [[Cersei Lannister]] from the kingdom of [[Westeros]]. He subsequently appeared in Martin's ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'' (1998) and ''[[A Storm of Swords]]'' (2000).

Joffrey is portrayed by Irish actor [[Jack Gleeson]] in the [[HBO]] television adaptation.&lt;ref name=HBOCast&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html#/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/joffrey-baratheon/bio/joffrey-baratheon.html |title=''Game of Thrones'' Cast and Crew: Joffrey Baratheon played by Jack Gleeson |publisher=[[HBO]] | accessdate=December 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html#/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/index.html|title=The Official Website for the HBO Series Game of Thrones - Season 4|work=HBO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grrm.livejournal.com/164794.html |title=From HBO |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307150640/http://grrm.livejournal.com/164794.html |archivedate=2016-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Joffrey Baratheon is not a [[Narration#Third-person|point of view]] character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, such as his uncle [[Tyrion Lannister]] and his one-time fiancée [[Sansa Stark]].  Joffrey is mostly a background character in the novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/map/special/areas-of-control/4/|title=Game of Thrones Viewer's Guide|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He inherits his mother's traditional Lannister looks, and has blond hair and green eyes, and is believed by many to be very handsome.

== Character description ==
In public, Joffrey is allegedly the oldest son and heir of King [[Robert Baratheon]] and Queen [[Cersei Lannister]], both of whom entered into a political marriage alliance after Robert took the throne by force from the 'Mad King' Aerys II Targaryen.  In reality, his biological father is his mother's twin brother, [[Jaime Lannister]]. He has a younger sister, [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]], and a younger brother, [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], both of whom are also products of Jaime and Cersei's incestuous relationship. Their sole biological grandparents, Tywin and Joanna Lannister, were also first cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/guide/houses/jbaratheon/|title=Game of Thrones Viewer's Guide|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joffrey is an amoral sadist who disguises his cruelty with a thin veneer of charm. This is best epitomized by his response when his (then) betrothed offends him: Joffrey pronounces that his mother had taught him never to strike a woman, and so commissions a knight of the Kingsguard to hit her instead. He enjoys forcing people to fight to the death, and enforces cruel punishments for lesser crimes. He has no sense of personal responsibility, blaming failures on others. He lacks self-control and often insults his allies and family members. Joffrey is one of the story's few characters to display no redeeming qualities whatsoever.

Joffrey is 12 years old at the beginning of ''A Game of Thrones'' (1996).

== Storylines ==
[[File:A Song of Ice and Fire arms of Joffrey Baratheon scroll.png|thumb|150px|alt=A coat of arms showing a gold on red lion and a black on gold crowned stag combatant.|Joffrey Baratheon's personal coat of arms]]

=== ''A Game of Thrones'' ===
Prince Joffrey is taken by his parents to Winterfell and is betrothed to [[Sansa Stark]] in order to create an alliance between House Baratheon and House Stark. At first, Joffrey is kind and polite to Sansa. However, he refuses to show sympathy with the family when [[Bran Stark]] falls from a tower; this makes Joffrey's uncle Tyrion have to physically punish him until he shows respect. While on the Kingsroad to King's Landing, Joffrey and Sansa come across [[Arya Stark]] practicing swordplay with a commoner Mycah. Joffrey accuses Mycah of assaulting a noble girl and makes a cut on his face with a sword. This causes Arya to hit Joffrey, allowing Mycah to escape. Joffrey then turns on Arya, making her [[Dire wolf|direwolf]] Nymeria attack Joffrey, injuring him. Later, Joffrey lies about the attack, saying it was unprovoked and demands Nymeria to be killed; however, Sansa's direwolf Lady is killed instead. He later orders his bodyguard and sworn sword [[Sandor Clegane|Sandor &quot;The Hound&quot; Clegane]] to kill Mycah and bring him back his corpse, which he does.

Later, Eddard Stark discovers that Joffrey is not King Robert's son and rightful heir, by examining the family history and realizing that black hair is a dominant trait in the Baratheon line, hence the blonde hair can be attributed to the incestuous relationship of [[Cersei Lannister|Queen Cersei]] and [[Jaime Lannister|Ser Jaime]]. This causes Eddard to refuse to acknowledge Joffrey's claim to the throne when [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert]] dies. He is taken into custody and his guards and household are murdered.

Sansa kneels and begs for Joffrey to spare her father's life and give him a chance to confess the treason. Joffrey promises Sansa that if Eddard truly does confess, he would be merciful. Reluctant at first, Eddard begrudgingly accepts Joffrey as the rightful King in order to spare Sansa's life. However, Joffrey, though pleased by Eddard's &quot;confession&quot;, says that he has no acceptance for traitors and instead beheads Eddard and later forces Sansa to look upon her father's head.

=== ''A Clash of Kings'' ===
Joffrey is briefly seen in ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'' (1998). He rules with whim and caprice, proving difficult for even his mother to control. Sansa becomes imprisoned to his will, and he frequently has his guards beat her when she displeases him. When [[Stannis Baratheon]] attacks King's Landing, Joffrey leaves the battlefield, damaging the morale of his army. The battle is only won by his uncle Tyrion's use of wildfire and his grandfather Tywin's last-minute counterattack aided by the forces of House Tyrell.

=== ''A Storm of Swords'' ===
Joffrey sets aside his earlier betrothal to Sansa Stark in favor of Margaery Tyrell, cementing an alliance between the Lannisters and House Tyrell. At Tyrion and Sansa's wedding, he humiliates his uncle and is outraged when his uncle threatens him after he commands him to consummate their marriage. Tyrion only avoids punishment when his father Tywin assures Joffrey that his uncle was drunk and had no intention of threatening the king. Later after the events of the &quot;Red Wedding&quot;, Joffrey gleefully plans on serving Sansa her recently deceased brother's head, when Tyrion and Tywin are outraged. Tyrion threatens Joffrey once again, and later Joffrey turns on Tywin, who responds by commanding Joffrey to be sent to his room, much to Joffrey's chagrin. During his wedding feast in the throne room, he presents an extremely offensive play of &quot;The War of the Five Kings, &quot; with each of the kings played by dwarves, to humiliate his uncle. He also repeatedly torments Tyrion and Sansa, forcing the former to be his cupbearer. At the conclusion of the dinner, however, Joffrey's wine is poisoned, and he dies in an event known as &quot;The Purple Wedding,&quot; in which Tyrion is falsely accused and arrested by Cersei in ''[[A Storm of Swords]]'' (2000). It is later revealed that Lady [[Olenna Tyrell]] and Lord [[Petyr Baelish]] were the true perpetrators, with assistance from royal fool Ser Dontos Hollard, who successfully smuggles Tyrion's wife Sansa out of King's Landing before either of them can be caught and tried for Joffrey's murder.

=== Later novels ===
Joffrey is mentioned a few times in the later novels.

===Storylines===
[[File:Jack Gleeson (August 2012) (headshot).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Jack Gleeson]] plays the role of Joffrey Baratheon in the [[Game of Thrones|television series]].]]
Joffrey Baratheon is the Crown Prince of the Seven Kingdoms. He is the eldest of Cersei Lannister's children and heir to the Iron Throne. Evil, arrogant, vicious, and cruel, he has a short temper and believes he can do anything he wants. He is also a coward when confronted by those who aren't afraid of him. Joffrey is also unaware that King Robert is not his real father – in reality, he is the son of Jaime Lannister.

====Season 1====
After Robert's death, the Lannisters make Joffrey King against his father's will, and his mother uses him as a puppet. A cruel ruler, Joffrey makes a mistake when, against Cersei's and Sansa's wishes, he refuses to honor his promise of sparing Ned; instead, Joffrey has him executed.

====Season 2====
His act worsens the situation with the Lannisters' war effort as his uncle Jaime is captured by the Starks and his uncles Renly and Stannis have challenged his claim to the Iron Throne. He frequently orders his Kingsguard to beat Sansa. His cruelty and ignorance of the commoners' suffering makes him unpopular after he orders the City Watch to kill all of his father's bastard children in King's Landing which would later lead to a riot where he is almost killed. When Stannis attacks King's Landing, Joffrey serves only as a figurehead and avoids the heavy fighting. When the battle eventually turns in Stannis' favor, Cersei calls her son into the safety of the castle, damaging the morale of his army. The battle is only won by his uncle Tyrion and his grandfather Tywin, aided by the forces of House Tyrell. To cement the alliance between their families, Joffrey's engagement to Sansa is annulled so he can marry Margaery Tyrell.

====Season 3====
The marriage is yet to take place, and rifts are growing between Joffrey and his uncle and grandfather, who are (in their respective ways) rebutting his cruelty. He also seems to take little interest in his bride, but is amazed and altered by her ways of winning the people's favor, in which he takes part. At Tyrion and Sansa's wedding, he humiliates his uncle and is outraged when his uncle threatens him after he commands him to consummate their marriage. Tyrion only avoids punishment when his father Tywin assures Joffrey that his uncle was drunk and had no intention of threatening the king. Later after the events of the &quot;Red Wedding&quot;, Joffrey gleefully plans on serving Sansa her recently deceased brother's head, when Tyrion and Tywin are outraged. Tyrion threatens Joffrey once again, and later Joffrey turns on Tywin, who responds by commanding Joffrey to be sent to his room, much to Joffrey's chagrin.

====Season 4====
Joffrey finally marries Margaery. During his wedding feast in the gardens of the Red Keep, he presents an extremely offensive play of &quot;The War of the Five Kings, &quot; with each of the kings played by dwarves, to humiliate his uncle. He also repeatedly torments Tyrion and Sansa, forcing the former to be his cupbearer. At the height of festivities Joffrey is suddenly overcome by poison, and he dies. His uncle Tyrion is accused and arrested. It is confirmed, however, he was poisoned by Olenna Tyrell, with assistance from Petyr Baelish and Dontos Hollard, as she wanted to protect Margaery from the physical and emotional abuse that Joffrey had very clearly inflicted on Sansa. Olenna later confides to Margaery that she would never have let her marry &quot;that monster&quot;. Following Joffrey's funeral, his younger brother and heir, Tommen, is crowned King and proceeds to marry Joffrey's widow Margaery.

== Reception ==
[[Jack Gleeson]] has received positive reviews for his role as Joffrey Baratheon in the television series. In 2016, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked the character #4 in their list of the &quot;40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/40-greatest-tv-villains-of-all-time-20160209 |title=40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=Sean T. |last=Collins |date=February 9, 2016 |accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Martin described Joffrey as similar to &quot;five or six people that I went to school with ... a classic bully ... incredibly spoiled&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdSPFJcxCNM | title=Game Of Thrones – Interview with George R.R.

'''Robb Stark''' is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series of [[fantasy]] novels by American author [[George R. R. Martin]], and its television adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

Introduced in 1996's ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'', Robb is the eldest child and son of [[Ned Stark|Eddard Stark]], the honorable lord of [[Winterfell]], an ancient fortress in [[the North (A Song of Ice and Fire)|the North]] of the fictional continent [[Westeros]]. He subsequently appeared in Martin's ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'' (1998) and ''[[A Storm of Swords]]'' (2000).

Robb is portrayed by Scottish actor [[Richard Madden]] in the [[HBO]] television adaptation.&lt;ref name=HBOCast&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html#/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/robb-stark/bio/robb-stark.html |title=''Game of Thrones'' Cast and Crew: Robb Stark played by Richard Madden |publisher=[[HBO]] | accessdate=December 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html#/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/index.html|title=The Official Website for the HBO Series Game of Thrones - Season 4|work=HBO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grrm.livejournal.com/164794.html |title=From HBO |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307150640/http://grrm.livejournal.com/164794.html |archivedate=2016-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character description ==
Robb is fourteen years old at the beginning of ''A Game of Thrones'' (1996). He is the eldest son of Eddard &quot;Ned&quot; Stark and his wife [[Catelyn Tully|Catelyn]], and has five siblings: [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], [[Arya Stark|Arya]], [[Bran Stark|Bran]], [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]], and the illegitimate half-brother [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]]. Robb is constantly accompanied by his [[direwolf (fictional creature)|direwolf]], Grey Wind.

Robb is the eldest legitimate son of Lord [[Eddard Stark]], and heir to Winterfell. When Lord Eddard relocates to [[King's Landing (A Song of Ice and Fire)|King's Landing]] to become the King's Hand, Robb remains at Winterfell to rule in his father's stead. When Eddard is beheaded by Ser [[Ilyn Payne]], Robb is declared King in the North by his bannermen rather than swear fealty to the [[Lannister]] king, [[Joffrey Baratheon]], drawing the lords of the North and of the Riverlands to his cause. Despite displaying a proficiency in military tactics in his victories against the Lannisters, he makes numerous political and strategic errors, culminating into his betrayal and murder by disgruntled allies [[Walder Frey]] and [[Roose Bolton]], all under discreet command of [[Tywin Lannister]] at the [[Red Wedding|wedding]] of his uncle, [[Edmure Tully]], to Frey's daughter Roslin.

== Development, overview and reception==
Robb Stark is not a [[Narration#Third-person|point of view]] character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, such as his mother and Theon Greyjoy. Robb is mostly a background character in the novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/map/special/areas-of-control/4/|title=Game of Thrones Viewer's Guide|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Poniewozik of ''Time'' describes Robb as less eager to seek retaliation than his father Eddard Stark but also as more pragmatic.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeAGC&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2011/05/23/game-of-thrones-watch-talk-to-the-hand/|title=Game of Thrones Watch: Talk to the Hand|work=Time|first=James|last=Poniewozik|accessdate=February 7, 2016|date=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeTPE&quot; /&gt;  His overview of the television version of Robb focuses on his role as a foil for Eddard:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Robb has risen to take his father’s place, as a lord of Winterfell and as a focal character in the show. We never saw what kind of warrior Ned was in the field, but in King’s Landing, he fought a straight-ahead battle, telegraphing his moves, and died for it. Robb, seeing the Lannisters' numbers, shows himself capable of feints and deceptions&amp;mdash;albeit at the cost of 2,000 men and the guilt of having sent them on a suicide mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeBaelor&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2011/06/13/game-of-thrones-watch-its-all-in-the-execution-2/|title=Game of Thrones Watch: The Unkindest Cut|work=Time|first=James|last=Poniewozik|accessdate=February 7, 2016|date=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the third novel, ''A Storm of Swords'', Robb Stark is assassinated in an event called the [[The Rains of Castamere|Red Wedding]], which was inspired by the [[Black Dinner]] and [[Glencoe Massacre]] from [[History of Scotland|Scottish history]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EWRed&quot; /&gt;  George Martin has said that he decided to kill Robb Stark because he wished to keep the story difficult to predict: &quot;I killed Ned because everybody thinks he’s the hero ... The next predictable thing is to think his eldest son is going to rise up and avenge his father. And everybody is going to expect that. So immediately [killing Robb] became the next thing I had to do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EWRed&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/06/02/game-of-thrones-author-george-r-r-martin-why-he-wrote-the-red-wedding/ | title='Game of Thrones' author George R.R.

In their 2015 book, ''Game of Thrones and Business'', Tim Phillips and Rebecca Claire agree: 
{{quote|But the Internet-crashing shock wasn't fundamentally about death.  There's loads of that on TV.  What really made this stand out was that it broke the rules &amp;ndash; the story just wasn't supposed to go this way.

== Storylines ==
[[File:Stark Coat of Arms.png|thumb|150px|alt=A coat of arms showing a gray wolf on a white field.|Coat of arms of House Stark]]

=== ''A Game of Thrones'' ===
When [[Eddard Stark|his father]] leaves for King's Landing to be made King Robert Baratheon's Hand, Robb becomes acting Lord of Winterfell.  After his father's arrest for presumed treason, he marches south with an army in attempt to free his father.  To secure passage through the Green Fork at the vital crossing of the Twins, Robb consents to the marriage to one of [[Walder Frey]]'s daughters or granddaughters negotiated by his mother Lady [[Catelyn Tully]].  After crossing the river, he surprises and destroys the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] army besieging Riverrun, capturing Jaime Lannister in the process.  Upon hearing of [[Eddard Stark|his father]]'s execution at King's Landing, Robb is crowned the King in the North by his bannermen, and the Riverlands lords also swear loyalty to him.

=== ''A Clash of Kings'' ===
Robb continues to win victories against the Lannister army, and earns the nickname &quot;Young Wolf&quot; for his ferocity in battle.  He sends his mother Lady Catelyn to negotiate an alliance with [[Renly Baratheon]], but Renly is assassinated by his brother [[Stannis Baratheon]] with blood magic from the red priestess [[Melisandre]].  As Stannis and the Starks still share a common enemy, Robb invades the Westerlands in order to strategically assist Stannis's campaign against the Lannisters.  He also sends [[Theon Greyjoy]] to Pyke in hope to win the alliance of Theon's father [[Balon Greyjoy]], ruler of the Iron Islands.  However Balon decides to take advantage and attack the North instead.  Theon joins his father and seizes Winterfell by surprise, where he is believed to have murdered Robb's youngest siblings [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]], though in reality they have escaped and gone into hiding.

=== ''A Storm of Swords'' ===
During one of his assaults in the Westerlands, Robb is wounded, at the same time learns the news of his brothers' apparent murder.  Falling ill due to mourning and injury, he falls in love with the noble maiden in charge of nursing him, [[Jeyne Westerling]], taking her virginity.  To preserve Jeyne's honor, Robb marries her, rescinding the previous marriage arrangement with [[House Frey]], causing the Freys to desert his army.  Meanwhile, [[Stannis Baratheon]], who has suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Blackwater, is urged by Melisandre to use blood magic with leeches to curse the three rival kings Joffrey, Robb and Balon.

After Stannis's defeat at the Blackwater, Robb withdraws from the Westerlands and returns to Riverrun to attend the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully.  Upon returning, Robb learns that his mother Lady Catelyn has secretly released the prisoner [[Jaime Lannister]] in the hope of exchanging her hostage daughter [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] in King's Landing.  This leads to the mutiny of Lord Rickard Karstark, whose two sons were slain by Jaime during the Battle of Whispering Woods, forcing Robb to execute Lord Rickard and losing the Karstark support.  As the war situation is looking bad, Robb tries to repair the alliance with the Freys, by bargaining his uncle Edmure Tully to marry Roslin Frey, hence rebuilding the marriage alliance.  The Freys then demand that Robb personally attend the wedding at the Twins as a gesture of apology.

On their way to the Twins, Robb learns that Balon Greyjoy has accidentally died, and the ironborn commanders are returning to the Iron Islands to attend Kingsmoot.  He decided to lead his army to retake the North immediately after the wedding is complete.  He soon learns that his sister Sansa has been forcibly married off to [[Tyrion Lannister]]. To prevent the Lannisters from claiming Winterfell through Sansa's child by Tyrion, against the opposition of his mother Catelyn, Robb disinherits Sansa and signs a decree legitimizing his half-brother [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]] as his heir if he happens to die with no children, and requests the Night's Watch release Jon from service.  He then entrusts the decree to Lord Galbart Glover and Lady Maege Mormont, sending them to secretly sail up the Neck seeking contact with Howland Reed, Lord of Greywater Watch, so he can launch a coordinated attack to recapture the strategically crucial Moat Cailin.  However at the Twins, the Northern convoy, who are unarmed in attendance to the wedding, are betrayed and massacred by the Freys during the wedding feast in an event known as the &quot;Red Wedding&quot;.  Robb is personally murdered by his chief vassal lord Roose Bolton, who has also secretly defected to the Lannisters and rewarded with the title of the Warden of the North.

== TV adaptation ==
[[File:Richard Madden by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Richard Madden]] plays the role of Robb Stark in the [[Game of Thrones|television series]].]]
Robb Stark is played by [[Richard Madden]] in the television adaption of the series of books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/game-of-thrones-q-a-richard-madden-on-robb-starks-endgame-20130602|title='Game of Thrones' Q&amp;A: Richard Madden on Robb Stark's Endgame|work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some slight differences between the TV portrayal and the book version of Robb. Due to the child characters' ages being increased, Robb's age is changed from 14 to 17 years old at the start of the series. Instead of marrying Jeyne Westering (as in the novels), he marries a healer from Volantis named Talisa Maegyr, who is also killed during the Red Wedding. And while Robb is a background character in the books, not having any chapters told from his perspective, he is listed ahead of Michelle Fairley, who plays POV character Catelyn Stark in the books, in the opening credits of many episodes, and we see the Stark's storyline in Seasons 2 and 3 revolve more around Robb in the viewers' eyes as opposed to the readers'.

James Poniewozik comments on Madden's performance in &quot;The Pointy End&quot; in ''Time'', saying &quot;both the script and Richard Madden show in deft, quick strokes how the crisis focuses him. (This is another case where having a live actor does a better job of showing a transition that seemed more abrupt in the book.)&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeTPE&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2011/06/06/game-of-thrones-watch-the-quality-of-mercy/|title=Game of Thrones Watch: the Quality of Mercy|work=Time|first=James|last=Poniewozik|accessdate=February 7, 2016|date=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madden said that he learned that the character would be killed off early on but otherwise read the books season by season, focusing primarily on the scripts: &quot;I'm, as an actor, forced to bend the path I put Robb on and change it and keep the surprises coming. Hopefully, I managed to do that.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/02/game-of-thrones-robb-stark_n_3368224.html|title='Game of Thrones' Robb Stark Speaks: Richard Madden Addresses Shocking Developments|author=Maureen Ryan|newspaper=Huffingtonpost.com|date=February 7, 2013|accessdate= February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storylines===
Robb Stark is the eldest son of Eddard and Catelyn Stark and the heir to Winterfell. His dire wolf is called Grey Wind. Robb becomes involved in the war against the Lannisters after his father, Ned Stark, is arrested for treason. Robb summons his bannermen for war against House Lannister and marches to the Riverlands. Eventually, crossing the river at the Twins becomes strategically necessary. To win permission to cross, Robb agrees to marry a daughter of Walder Frey, Lord of the Twins. Robb leads the war effort against the Lannisters and successfully captures Jaime. After Ned is executed, the North and the Riverlands declare their independence from the Seven Kingdoms and proclaim Robb as their new King, &quot;The King in the North&quot;.

He wins a succession of battles in Season 2, earning him the nickname the Young Wolf. However, he feels that he botched the political aspects of war. He sends Theon to the Iron Islands hoping that he can broker an alliance with Balon Greyjoy, Theon's father. In exchange for Greyjoy support, Robb as King in the North will recognize the Iron Islands' independence. He also sends his mother Catelyn to deal with Stannis Baratheon and Renly Baratheon, both of whom are fighting to be the rightful king. Theon and Catelyn fail in their missions, and Balon launches an invasion of the North. Robb falls in love with Talisa Maegyr, a healer from Volantis due to her kindness and spirit. Despite his mother's protest, Robb breaks his engagement with the Freys and marries Talisa in the 2nd-season finale. On news of his grandfather, Lord Hoster Tully's, death, Robb and his party travel north to Riverrun for the funeral, where the young king is reunited with his great-uncle, Brynden Blackfish, and his uncle, Edmure Tully, the new lord of Riverrun. While at Riverrun, Robb makes the decision to execute Lord Rickard Karstark for the murders of two teenage squires related to the Lannisters, a decision that loses the support of the Karstarks and leads Robb to make the ultimately fatal decision to ask the Freys for their alliance. He is killed in the Red Wedding Massacre, after witnessing the murder of his pregnant wife and their unborn child. Lord Bolton personally executes Robb, stabbing him through the heart while taunting that &quot;the Lannisters send their regards&quot;, in fact a promise made to Jaime (who had no knowledge of Bolton's impending treason) when leaving for the Twins. His corpse is later decapitated and Grey Wind's head is sewn on and paraded around as the Stark forces are slaughtered by the Freys and the Boltons. Though House Stark is stripped of all lands and titles by House Lannister as a result of Robb's death and his ultimately failed rebellion against the Iron Throne, he and his mother are later avenged in [[Game of Thrones (Season 6)|Season 6]] and [[Dragonstone (Game of Thrones)|the first episode]] of [[Game of Thrones (Season 7)|Season 7]] when his half-brother Jon Snow and sister Sansa Stark successfully overthrow House Bolton and retake Winterfell and Jon is crowned the King in the North by the remaining Northern lords, wildlings, and Knights of the Vale, restoring Stark rule in the North in the process, while his youngest sister Arya Stark returns to Westeros, murders Walder Frey, and later uses his face to disguise herself as him to poison all his sons and male descendants at the Twins, ultimately avenging the Red Wedding and exterminating House Frey.

==In other media==

In his article &quot;The War in Westeros and Just War Theory,&quot; Richard H. Corrigan uses Robb to illustrate the concepts of [[just cause]] and [[right intention]] in the decision to go to war: &quot;Robb is not only fighting this war to ensure that his fellow Northerners have a just king [Robb's cause].  He is also doing it to avenge his father, Ned, and to recover his sisters Arya and Sansa [Robb's intention].&quot; Corrigan speculates that Robb may be suffering from [[cognitive dissonance]] and says that, ethically, once Robb has achieved his cause, he is obligated to cease fighting even if he has not yet avenged his family.&lt;ref name=GoTPhil&gt;{{Citation

==Plot==

===Beyond the Wall===
North of the Wall, Sam and Gilly continue their march south. Sam tells Gilly he plans for them to cross the Wall using the entrance at the Nightfort, an abandoned castle along the Wall.

===In the North===
South of the Wall, Bran and his group take shelter in an abandoned mill. Nearby, Jon and the wildling party raid an elderly horse breeder's home, taking his horses and gold while the old man flees. While in the mill, Bran and Jojen Reed discuss how they plan to cross the Wall, before Meera spots the old horse breeder riding nearby. After the old man is captured by the wildlings, Hodor—scared by the thunder—begins yelling, which threatens to give away their location to the wildlings. Bran uses his warg abilities to enter Hodor's mind and knocks him out.

Outside, Tormund moves to kill the old man, but Orell tells him to have Jon do it instead to prove his loyalty. Jon is ultimately unable to kill the innocent man, and instead Ygritte kills the man with an arrow. Realizing where Jon's loyalties lie, Tormund orders his men to kill him, but Jon manages to defeat them. As Ygritte moves to defend him, Jon deliberately knocks her to the ground, allowing Tormund to hold her down and prevent her from getting killed, while he battles with Orell. Bran enters the mind of Summer, his direwolf, and aids Jon. Jon kills Orell while the wolves hold off the other wildlings, and is then able to steal a horse and escape, leaving Ygritte and heading back to the Wall. At night, Bran asks Osha to take Rickon to Last Hearth, the home of the Umber family, and they depart shortly after.

===In Yunkai===
Planning their invasion of Yunkai, Daario tells Daenerys and her knights about a rear gate to the city, through which they can sneak in and open the main gate for her army. Ser Jorah is suspicious of Daario and his plan, but comes around when Daenerys seeks Grey Worm's opinion. When night falls, Daario, Jorah, and Grey Worm arrive at the gate. Daario enters ahead of them, posing as a still loyal Second Son commander. Shortly after being let inside the city, he signals Jorah and Grey Worm to follow him. Soon, they are ambushed by a group of Yunkai's slave soldiers, and though largely outnumbered, manage to kill them and accomplish the mission. The group returns to Daenerys, and tells her that she is now in control of the city.

===At the Twins===
[[File:Game of Thrones Oslo exhibition 2014 - Red Wedding weapons.jpg|thumb|The dagger with which Roose Bolton kills Robb Stark, and the knife with which Catelyn Stark kills Walder Frey's wife.]]
At camp, Catelyn counsels her son Robb, the King in the North, about his planned alliance with Lord Walder Frey and his planned assault on Casterly Rock, the homeland of the Lannisters. The Stark host soon arrives at the Twins, castle homeland of the Freys, where they are given bread and salt, a symbol of the &quot;guest right&quot;: a guarantee of safety when under another lord's roof. Robb makes an apology to both the sarcastic Walder Frey and his daughters. Walder accepts the apology but insists on inspecting Talisa, the woman for whom Robb broke his vow. Nearby, Arya, though still a captive of Sandor Clegane, journeys to the Twins to reunite with her mother and brother. When they come upon a trader and his cart, Clegane knocks him out and moves to kill him, but Arya manages to dissuade him, and he instead steals the cart of food.

At night, Walder walks his daughter Roslin down the aisle to her future husband Edmure Tully, who is pleasantly surprised by her beauty. They are married shortly after, and the celebration begins. At the feast, Walder calls for the [[bedding ceremony]], and the couple are taken to their chamber. After they leave, Lothar Frey closes the banquet hall doors, and the Frey bards begin playing &quot;The Rains of Castamere&quot;, a Lannister cautionary song, both of which arouse Catelyn's suspicions. Using the food cart as their reason for being at the Twins, the Hound and Arya arrive at the wedding. They are turned away at the gates, but Arya sneaks in.

Catelyn notices Roose Bolton wearing [[chainmail]] under his robes which confirms Catelyn's suspicions that they have been betrayed. Just as Walder signals his men to attack the Starks' men, Catelyn tries to warn Robb, but before he can react, Lothar repeatedly stabs the pregnant Talisa in the uterus, killing her and her unborn child. As he tries to draw his sword, Robb is shot by crossbows, and the massacre of his bannermen begins. Arya, having snuck past the gate, witnesses Frey men kill Stark soldiers and Robb's direwolf, Grey Wind. She is saved by the Hound, who knocks her unconscious and carries her out of the castle. Catelyn, although wounded by a crossbow bolt, holds Walder's young wife, Joyeuse, hostage with a knife and demands that Robb be allowed to leave. Walder refuses, and Roose Bolton stabs Robb in the heart, delivering Jaime's &lt;!--Do not insert a link to previous episodes here, per WP:EGG.--&gt;message from Harrenhal, &quot;The Lannisters send their regards.&quot;&lt;!--Do not insert a link to previous episodes here, per WP:EGG.--&gt; Catelyn screams and kills Joyeuse in retaliation, before Frey's son Black Walder cuts Catelyn's throat.

==Production==

===Writing===
&quot;The Rains of Castamere&quot; was written by executive producers [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]], based on [[George R. R. Martin]]'s original work from his novel ''[[A Storm of Swords]]''. The episode adapts content from chapters 41 to 43 and 50 to 53 (Bran III, Jon V, Daenerys IV, Catelyn VI, Arya X, Catelyn VII, and Arya XI).&lt;ref name=&quot;westeros&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westeros.org/GoT/Episodes/Entry/The_Rains_of_Castamere/Book_Spoilers/|title=EP309:The Rains of Castamere|publisher=Westeros.org|first=Elio|last=Garcia|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode includes one of the most important plot turns of the series: the betrayal and assassination of the Stark forces during a marriage ceremony in what came to be known as the &quot;Red Wedding&quot;. The event culminates in Roose Bolton delivering Jaime Lannister's message from &quot;[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair#At Harrenhal|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]&quot;, before killing Robb. This tragic turn of events had a profound impact on Benioff and Weiss in their first read of the novels and it was the scene that convinced them to attempt to obtain the rights for a television series.&lt;ref name=&quot;EW&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Hibberd|first=James|title='Game of Thrones' showrunners on season 2, splitting Book 3 and their hope for a 70-hour epic|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/03/30/game-of-thrones-showrunners-season-2/2/|accessdate=May 5, 2013|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|quote=Oh, my God, we’ve got to get this.

[[File:Edinburgh Castle, Edinburgh - geograph.org.uk - 505910.jpg|thumb|230px|The Red Wedding was inspired by the [[Black Dinner]] that took place in 1440 at [[Edinburgh Castle]].]]
George R. R. Martin conceived The Red Wedding during the earliest stages of the planning of his saga, when he was envisioning a trilogy with The Red Wedding as one of the climactic events at the end of the first of the three books.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Martin was inspired by a couple of events in [[History of Scotland|Scottish history]]. One of them was the 15th century historical event known as the &quot;[[Black Dinner]]&quot;, where the Scottish king invited the chieftains of the powerful [[Clan Douglas]] to a feast at [[Edinburgh Castle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EW2&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/06/02/game-of-thrones-author-george-r-r-martin-why-he-wrote-the-red-wedding/ | title='Game of Thrones' author George R.R. Martin: Why he wrote The Red Wedding | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=June 2, 2013 | accessdate=June 4, 2013 | author=Hibberd, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; A black bull's head, the symbol of death, was served as the last course of the dinner while a single drum was playing in the background, and the Douglases were murdered.&lt;ref name=&quot;EW2&quot;/&gt; Another event from which the author drew inspiration was the 1692 [[Massacre of Glencoe]], where [[MacDonald of Glencoe|Clan MacDonald]] hosted the [[Clan Campbell|Campbell Clan]] who killed thirty-eight of their hosts overnight.&lt;ref name=&quot;EW2&quot;/&gt;

Martin has said The Red Wedding was the hardest thing he has ever written. He explained that he always tries to put himself in the skin of his characters when writing from their perspective, and develops bonds with them. He even felt attached to the minor characters killed during the massacre. It was so painful for him that he skipped the chapter and continued writing, and only when the rest of the book was finished, he &quot;forced himself&quot; to come back to the dreaded scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1496|title=George R. R. Martin Webchat Transcript|newspaper=[[Empire Magazine]]|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, at ComicCon he even joked that &quot;he will visit a country with no television when the episode goes on air&quot;.

Martin also said he killed off Robb because he believed the audience would assume that the story was about Ned Stark's heir avenging his death and wished to keep them guessing.&lt;ref name=&quot;EW2&quot;/&gt; He later suggested Talisa — whose counterpart Jeyne Westerling was not killed in the books — died so Robb's heir could not avenge his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/02/game-of-thrones-robb-stark_n_3368224.html|title='Game Of Thrones' Robb Stark Speaks: Richard Madden Addresses Shocking Developments|author=Maureen Ryan|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
The episode was widely praised by critics and cited as one of the best of the series. [[Rotten Tomatoes]], a prominent [[review aggregator]], surveyed 21 reviews of the installment and judged 100% of them to be positive with an average score of 9.9 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, &quot;The most unforgettable episode of Game of Thrones thus far, 'The Rains of Castamere' (or as it shall forever be known, 'The Red Wedding') packs a dramatic wallop that feels as exquisitely shocking as it does ultimately inevitable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/game-of-thrones/s03/e09/|title=The Rains of Castamere|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the comments were directed at the massacre at the end of the episode, where praise was especially given to [[Michelle Fairley]]'s performance, leading to the disappointment of many critics when she was not nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]] for the [[65th Primetime Emmy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wood|first1=Daniel|title=Game of Thrones: Michelle Fairley is shunned by the Emmy Awards, but the show picks up 17 nominations|url=https://uk.tv.yahoo.com/game-thrones-michelle-fairley-shunned-emmy-awards-show-101800614.html|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|accessdate=June 22, 2014|date=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]]'s Matt Fowler gave the episode a perfect 10/10, calling it &quot;an exquisitely awful event that managed to out-do the unpredictable and horrifying death of Ned Stark back in Season 1&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fowler2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/06/03/game-of-thrones-the-rains-of-castamere-review|title=Game of Thrones: &quot;The Rains of Castamere&quot; Review|last=Fowler|first=Matt|publisher=IGN|date=June 2, 2013|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fowler also said he believed that the episode's depiction of the Red Wedding was more powerful than its depiction in ''A Song of Ice and Fire''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fowler&quot;/&gt;

Writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', both David Sims and Todd VanDerWerff gave the episode an &quot;A&quot; grade. Sims (writing for people who have not read the novels) expressed shock at the deaths of several main characters, writing, &quot;I don’t think I’ve really processed what I just watched&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;av1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-rains-of-castamere,98087/|title=&quot;The Rains of Castamere&quot; (for newbies)|last=Sims|first=David|publisher=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=June 2, 2013|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; VanDerWerff, who reviews the episodes for people who have read the novels, wrote &quot;If [the reader] doesn’t terribly want to deal with the thought of the deaths of Catelyn and Robb, well, he or she can read that much more quickly.

For its 65th anniversary, ''[[TV Guide]]'' picked &quot;The Rains of Castamere&quot; as the third best episode of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Hahn |first=Kate |date=April 2-15, 2018 |title=65 Best Episodes of the 21st Century |url= |magazine=TV Guide |location= |publisher= |access-date=March 29, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viewer reception===
The episode was also notable for the intense and emotional response it pulled from viewers, many of whom were unaware of what was about to transpire and had their reactions filmed by people who had read the book on which it was based. This led to George R. R. Martin giving his personal analysis of the reactions, which he stated were on par with the responses he received from readers of ''A Storm of Swords''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EW2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2013/06/06/game-of-thrones-the-rains-of-castamere-summed-up-in-videos/ |title=Game of Thrones – ‘The Rains of Castamere’ summed up in videos &amp;#124; Neela Debnath &amp;#124; Independent Arts Blogs |work=[[The Independent]] |date=June 6, 2013 |accessdate=June 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610082630/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2013/06/06/game-of-thrones-the-rains-of-castamere-summed-up-in-videos/ |archivedate=June 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chai |first=Barbara |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/06/06/george-r-r-martin-watches-reactions-to-the-red-wedding/ |title=George R.R.

'''''Valentinian''''' is a [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] era stage play, a [[revenge tragedy]] written by [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] was that originally published in the [[Beaumont and Fletcher folios|first Beaumont and Fletcher folio]] of [[1647 in literature|1647]]. The play dramatizes the story of [[Valentinian III]], one of the last of the Roman Emperors, as recorded by the classical historian [[Procopius]]. His assassin is based on [[Magnus Maximus]], Valentinian's successor. 

==Date, source, performance==
Scholars date the play to the 1610–14 period. As he did with ''[[Monsieur Thomas]],'' another play of the same era, Fletcher used the second part of the novel ''[[L'Astrée]]'' by [[Honoré D'Urfé]], as one of his sources; and Part 2 of ''Astrée'' was first published in [[1610 in literature|1610]]. The play was performed by the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]; the cast list added to the play in the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of [[1679 in literature|1679]] mentions [[Richard Burbage]], [[Henry Condell]], [[John Lowin]], [[William Ostler]], and [[John Underwood (actor)|John Underwood]]. Since Ostler died in December 1614, ''Valentinian'' must have been written and staged between those two dates.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Kerchever Chambers|E. K. Chambers]], ''The Elizabethan Stage,'' 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The plot==
Fletcher portrays Valentinian as a lustful and rapacious [[tyrant]], comparable to the King in ''[[The Maid's Tragedy]].'' His Empire is decadent and collapsing, his soldiers mutinous. Valentinian rapes the virtuous Lucina; she then commits suicide. Lucina's husband, the upright soldier Maximus, devotes himself to obtaining revenge against the Emperor, though his friend Aecius tries to dissuade him. Maximus finally succeeds as Valentinian dies a painful and drawn-out death by poison. Maximus is crowned by the Senate for overthrowing the tyrant, only to die himself soon after.

(Curiously, the play was published with an Epilogue suited to a comedy – an apparent print-shop blunder.)

==After 1660==
Like many plays in Fletcher's canon, ''Valentinian'' was both revived and adapted during the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] period. An adaptation under the same title by the poet and playwright [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]] was staged in [[1684 in literature|1684]] at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] and published in [[1685 in literature|1685]]. Rochester changed the play's order of scenes and eliminated the final act entirely, making Fletcher's heroine Lucina the central focus of the drama.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Colby Sprague, ''Beaumont and Fletcher on the Restoration Stage,'' Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1926; pp. 165–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

A setting by [[Robert Johnson (English composer)|Robert Johnson]] of the song &quot;Care charming sleep,&quot; the text of which is adapted from a sonnet by John Daniel, dates from about the time of the original production.  The [[1684 in music|1684]] adaptation featured music composed by [[Louis Grabu]].

==Critical responses==
Critics generally do not place Fletcher's play in the first rank of English Renaissance tragedies; the play has been criticized for &quot;its disunity of plot, structural faults, and support of tyranny....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., ''The Later Jacobean and Caroline Dramatists: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama,'' Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1978; p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; But the play has been considered influential on the Restoration tragedy that followed.

Modern critics have discussed the play's politics and sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon MacMullan, ''The Politics of Unease in the Plays of John Fletcher.'' Amherst, MA, [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1995; pp. 95–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Bamford, ''Sexual Violence on the Jacobean Stage,'' London, Palgrave Macmillan, 2000; pp. 100–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;'''The Ghost of Harrenhal'''&quot; is the fifth episode of the [[Game of Thrones (season 2)|second season]] of [[HBO]]'s [[medieval fantasy]] television series ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. The episode is written by series co-creators [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]] and directed, for the second time in this season, by [[David Petrarca]]. It premiered on April 29, 2012.

“The Ghost of Harrenhal” is how [[Arya Stark]] describes herself while at Harrenhal in ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'', the novel on which the season is based, although the phrase is not heard in the episode.

This episode marks the final appearance of [[Gethin Anthony]].
==Plot==

===In the Stormlands===
King Renly Baratheon and Catelyn Stark negotiate an alliance in his tent with Brienne of Tarth standing guard, when the shadow creature birthed by Melisandre suddenly enters and fatally stabs Renly before disappearing. Two of Renly's guards enter the tent and, taking Brienne for the murderer, attack her. She slays them and is convinced by Catelyn to escape with her so that Brienne may at least avenge Renly someday. During their journey, Brienne swears allegiance to Catelyn, who promises not to interfere with Brienne's vengeance on Stannis Baratheon, whom she believes played a role in Renly's murder.

Meanwhile, Renly's death causes confusion amongst his men. Ser Loras Tyrell also holds Stannis responsible for Renly's death and wants revenge, but Petyr Baelish and Renly's widow Margaery Tyrell convince him that they must escape before Stannis' fleet arrives. As Stannis reaches the camp, his dead brother's bannermen swear fealty to him, but Davos Seaworth warns him to stay away from Melisandre because his men whisper that she is controlling him. Stannis takes Davos's advice not to bring Melisandre with him during his forthcoming assault on King's Landing, and gives a reluctant Davos the command of the fleet in the coming siege of King's Landing.

===In King's Landing===
Tyrion blackmails more information out of his cousin Lancel, who reveals that Cersei has been stockpiling massive amounts of &quot;wildfire,&quot; a dangerous flammable substance. While crossing the city with Bronn, Tyrion is unsurprised at hearing an agitator rail against the incest-born king, but surprised and hurt to hear himself blamed for Joffrey's misdeeds. He visits the royal pyromancer, Wisdom Hallyne, who reveals a secret cache of close to eight thousand pots of wildfire that Joffrey intends to catapult onto Stannis' forces when they attack the city. Bronn doubts the effectiveness of the plan, but Tyrion decides to use it and claims the cache for himself.

===At Lordsport===
Theon Greyjoy has been made the captain of a single ship, with orders to raid fishing villages on the northern coast. Before even setting sail, Theon's crew openly disrespect him and abandon him on shore. Theon's first mate Dagmer Cleftjaw comes to his assistance and suggests that Theon will need to win the respect of the men with a more impressive deed. When Dagmer proposes an assault on the Northern town of Torrhen's Square, Theon disagrees at first, saying that the raid will attract the attention of Winterfell's forces, but later realizes that Dagmer intends to besiege Torrhen's Square in order to leave Winterfell poorly defended for his takeover.

===At Winterfell===
Bran receives the news that Torrhen's Square is under assault, and urges Ser Rodrik Cassel to raise a force to defend it. Later he tells Osha of his recent dreams wherein the ocean floods, destroying Winterfell and its inhabitants. He also asks Osha about the &quot;three-eyed raven&quot; that appears in his dreams, but Osha deflects his inquiries.

===At the Fist of the First Men===
On their trek northwards, the Night's Watch meet up with the legendary ranger Qhorin Halfhand at the Fist of the First Men, an ancient fortification. Qhorin warns that the wildlings have become more organized and dangerous under the leadership of former ranger Mance Rayder (the King Beyond the Wall). With a small party, Qhorin intends to approach and eliminate a wildling watchpost. Jon Snow volunteers to join Qhorin, which he is eventually allowed to do.

===In Qarth===
Daenerys Targaryen enjoys holding court at Qarth and watching her dragons grow. At a party given by her rich host Xaro Xhoan Daxos, the warlock Pyat Pree invites Daenerys to visit the &quot;House of the Undying,&quot; while the masked Quaithe warns Ser Jorah Mormont of dangers that face Daenerys. Later, Xaro asks Daenerys for her hand in marriage in exchange for enough wealth and power to take King's Landing. Jorah vehemently opposes this, arguing that she needs to win the [[Iron Throne (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Iron Throne]] on her own rather than as a perceived foreign puppet. After questioning Jorah's motives, Daenerys eventually hears him out and agrees with him.

===At Harrenhal===
Arya Stark serves as cupbearer for Lord Tywin Lannister. During a meeting with his lieutenants regarding the war, Tywin deduces that she is a Northerner, but remains unaware of her identity. Later, Arya encounters Jaqen H'ghar, whom she had rescued along with Rorge and Biter, and who is now disguised as a Lannister guardsman. Jaqen offers to return her past favor by offering her &quot;three lives&quot; he will claim for the Red God, as a compensation for the three lives she saved. Arya designates &quot;The Tickler,&quot; Harrenhal's cruel interrogator, as her first victim. Soon enough, he is found dead with a broken neck, and Jaqen signals to Arya that the first debt has been paid.

==Production==

===Writing===
[[File:D. B. Weiss and David Benioff.jpg|right|thumb|The episode was written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.]]
&quot;The Ghost of Harrenhal&quot; is the fifth episode of the second season written by the two [[showrunner]]s [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]], and the fifteenth in the whole series. The script is based on the chapters Daenerys II, Arya VII, Catelyn IV, Jon IV, Bran V, Catelyn V, and Jon V (28, 31, 34, 35, 36, 40, and 44) from [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Clash of Kings]]''. Tyrion's scenes with the Pyromancers and Cersei are taken from the chapters Tyrion V and Tyrion VIII (21 and 37).&lt;ref name=&quot;westeros&quot; /&gt;

There are numerous divergences from the source material: in the books Lord Baelish is sent by the Council to negotiate with the Tyrells only after Renly is dead; Theon's departure from Pyke is not shown, and Dagmer Cleftjaw is a scarred old master-at-arms who is fond of Theon because Cleftjaw trained him when Theon was a boy; Arya is a scullion instead of a cupbearer and is not able to interact with Lord Tywin; and the character of Xaro Xhoan Daxos has been drastically changed making him a heterosexual of humble origins and giving him a vault that is never mentioned in the books.&lt;ref name=&quot;westeros&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.westeros.org/GoT/Episodes/Entry/The_Ghost_of_Harrenhal/Book_Spoilers/|title=EP205: The Ghost of Harrenhal|work=westeros.org|first=Elio|last=Garcia|accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
The episode introduces the character of the pyromancer &quot;Wisdom&quot; Hallyne, played by the British actor [[Roy Dotrice]]. Dotrice is a personal friend of [[George R. R. Martin]], since the two met while working on the 1980s hit TV series, ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1987 TV series)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (Martin as a producer, and Dotrice playing &quot;Father&quot;). Years later, Dotrice was Martin's choice to read the audiobooks of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'', a work that brought Dotrice a Guinness World Record for the largest number of characters voiced in an audiobook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=

After the series was greenlighted, Martin wanted to involve Dotrice, suggesting Maester Aemon, Rodrik Cassel or Grand Maester Pycelle as possible roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grrm.livejournal.com/86651.html?thread=6098299|title=The Beans Are Spilled|work=Not a Blog|first=George R. R.|last=Martin|accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was eventually cast as Pycelle,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grrm.livejournal.com/158167.html|title=Fessing Up|work=Not a Blog|first=George R. R.|last=Martin|accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he had to withdraw from the show for medical reasons and [[Julian Glover]] was cast to replace him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grrm.livejournal.com/168109.html|title=A Change on the Small Council|work=Not a Blog|first=George R. R.|last=Martin|accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second season, with his health recovered, he was given the role of Hallyne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grrm.livejournal.com/231396.html?thread=14435300|title=Hot New Casting Hints|work=Not a Blog|first=George R. R.|last=Martin|accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other characters introduced in the episode are the Night's Watch ranger Qhorin Halfhand, played by Simon Armstrong, and the mysterious Quaithe, played by the German actress Laura Pradelska. This is also the first episode in which Pyat Pree (briefly seen standing in Episode 4) has any lines.

===Filming locations===
The episode's interior shots were filmed at [[The Paint Hall]] studios, close to Belfast, where the main sets are located. Also in Northern Ireland were filmed the scenes at Harrenhal (in a set built near Banbridge) and Pyke (at the port of Ballintoy). Renly's camp was once again filmed on the country's northern coast.
[[File:Snæfellsjökull19Ice.JPG|thumb|The crew used the Icelandic volcano of [[Snæfellsjökull]] to represent the vast mountain chains of the Frostfangs.]]
After having filmed the Night's Watch storyline beyond the Wall in Irish forests for the first four episodes of the season, the producers decided that the unexplored land further to the north would be filmed in Iceland. According to the creator George R. R. Martin's vision of the setting, &quot;the area closest to my Wall is densely forested (...). And then as you get further and further north, it changes. You get into tundra and ice fields and it becomes more of an arctic environment. You have plains on one side and a very high range of mountains on the other.&quot;

Co-Producer Chris Newman said that until then they had been able to reproduce the lands north of the Wall by adding artificial snow, but now they needed a bigger landscape. According to David Benioff, they always &quot;wanted something shatteringly beautiful and barren and brutal for this part of Jon's journey, because he's in the true North now.&quot;

To represent the Frostfangs and The Fist of the First Men, the production filmed at the glacier at [[Snæfellsjökull]], and also at the glacier of Svínafellsjökull in Smyrlabjörg and the hills of Höfðabrekkuheiði (near [[Vík í Mýrdal|Vík]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smartertravel.com/blogs/today-in-travel/game-of-thrones-in-the-real-world-see-where-the-hbo-hit-was-filmed.html?id=10712211

[[File:Lokrum - former abbey.JPG|thumb|left|The Benedictine monastery of [[Lokrum]] was used as a Qartheen garden.]]
The other main location introduced in the episode was the gardens of Qarth, which were filmed at the Benedictine monastery of the Croatian island of Lokrum. The abandoned monastery was built in Gothic-Renaissance style in the 15th century.

The island of Lokrum is only 680 metres offshore from Dubrovnik, the location used for King Landing's exteriors, and can be reached by boat in 15 minutes. Coincidentally, Lokrum shares with its fictional counterpart of Qarth having peacocks among its distinctive features: Lokrum is inhabited by families of peacocks that were introduced to the island in the 19th century by the Austrian archduke [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.autoeurope.com/destination-spotlight/game-of-travel

|quote = &quot;A central challenge of Game of Thrones is that it presented most of its central cast together, then scattered them to (more or less, as of now) a half-dozen different locations. Generally the series has done a remarkable job, even as it rushes through a lot of story, of making their threads feel connected, even when they’re not in each other's presence. Jon Snow and his men in black have felt like the most disconnected from the rest of the story this season: they're playing the show's long game, the existential threat of the White Walkers. (...) As rich as their story is in mystery and mythology–this week we get some information about the 'First Men' who colonized Westeros thousands of years ago–it can feel like watching a separate show within a show.&quot;

One of VanDerWerff's criticisms of the episode is that it was too cluttered for him, treating important moments such as Renly's death in a matter of moments and moving away fast to the next thing.&lt;ref name=&quot;av2&quot;/&gt; In his opinion this was because this was the first episode of the season to incorporate all the locations instead of omitting one or two.  Elio Garcia of Westeros.org shared this view, saying that while many individual scenes were very good he missed a strong narrative thread connecting the multiple storylines.

Renly's death received many criticisms: David Sims wrote that Renly's death &quot;came out of nowhere,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;av1&quot;/&gt; Todd VanderWerff found it too rushed, and Elio Garcia said that due to director David Petrarca's mediocre direction choices, the effect of what should have been one of the most shocking scenes of the season was ruined. Garcia extended his harsh criticism to the scene depicting the aftermath of Renly's death and specially the decision to portray Loras' reaction to the murder of his lover with a contained grief instead of the book's homicidal rage.

On the other hand, the exchange between Arya and Tywin was unanimously praised, both in terms of acting and direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;ew&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;telev&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;av1&quot;/&gt; Writing for ''The Huffington Post'', Maureen Ryan commended Maisie Williams for being able to hold her own in a scene with the charismatic Charles Dance.&lt;ref name=&quot;huf&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/maureen-ryan/game-of-thrones-recap_b_1459282.html|title='Game of Thrones' Recap: Finding Light Amid The Darkness|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|first=Maureen|last=Ryan|accessdate=May 4, 2012|date=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another scene that was usually highlighted was Brienne's pledge of fealty to Catelyn Stark. Lacob described Christie's acting superlative, rendering a tragic air to Brienne,&lt;ref name=&quot;telev&quot;/&gt; while VanDerWerff noted how Fairley's subtle performance with just a hint of tears and wavering voice made the scene almost a perfect one.&lt;ref name=&quot;av2&quot;/&gt;

Other aspects that were praised by the reviewers were the production choice of filming in Iceland due to the magnificence and beauty of the shots, and good work done by the CGI team in making the dragon look like a real animal.&lt;ref name=&quot;huf&quot;/&gt; Also, the reviewer Myles McNutt who coined the term &quot;[[sexposition]]&quot; to describe the use of sex in the show, noted that this was the first episode that did not feature nudity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cultural-learnings.com/2012/04/29/game-of-thrones-the-ghosts-of-harrenhal/|title=Game of Thrones – &quot;The Ghosts of Harrenhal&quot;|work=Cultural Learnings|first=Myles|last=McNutt|accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Renly Baratheon''' is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series of [[fantasy]] novels by American author [[George R. R. Martin]], and its television adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

Introduced in 1996's ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'', Renly is the youngest of the three sons of [[Lord]] Steffon Baratheon and Cassana Estermont.

Renly Baratheon is portrayed by [[Gethin Anthony]] in the [[HBO]] television adaptation.&lt;ref name=HBOCast&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html#/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/gethin-anthony/bio/gethin-anthony.html |title=''Game of Thrones'' Cast and Crew: Renly Baratheon played by Gethin Anthony |publisher=[[HBO]] | accessdate=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html#/game-of-thrones/cast-and-crew/index.html|title=The Official Website for the HBO Series Game of Thrones|work=HBO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grrm.livejournal.com/164794.html |title=From HBO |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307150640/http://grrm.livejournal.com/164794.html |archivedate=2016-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character description ==
Renly Baratheon is the younger brother of King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]  and of King [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]].{{Sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix}} He is portrayed as a handsome and charismatic man, winning friends easily. Because of that, he's quite popular with the smallfolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tor.com/2012/03/16/a-read-of-ice-and-fire-a-clash-of-kings-part-11/|title=A Read of Ice and Fire: A Clash of Kings, Part 11|publisher=Tor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development, overview and reception==
Renly Baratheon is not a [[Narration#Third-person|point of view]] character in the novels, so his actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of other people, such as [[Eddard Stark]] and [[Catelyn Stark]]. Renly is mostly a background character in the novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/map/special/areas-of-control/4/|title=Game of Thrones Viewer's Guide|publisher=HBO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storylines ==
===In the books===
[[File:Baratheon Flag.jpg|upright|thumb|alt=Banner of arms showing a black stag on a yellow field.|Banner of arms of King Renly Baratheon in the books|left]]
Renly Baratheon is the youngest of the Baratheon brothers and Lord of Storm's End. He is described as handsome and charismatic, winning friends easily. Renly serves on Robert's council as Master of Laws. After Robert dies, Renly declares himself King of the Seven Kingdoms in ''A Clash of Kings'', wins the support of the Baratheon bannermen as he is their Lord Paramount, and seals an alliance with [[House Tyrell]] by marrying [[Margaery Tyrell]]. Before he can march on the capital though, he hears Stannis is besieging Storm's End. Renly marches there, intending to kill his brother in battle, and turning down an offer to become Stannis' heir. Before the battle he is assassinated by a shadow conjured by Melisandre, though it is unclear if Stannis is aware of this or not.

Renly Baratheon is played by the British actor [[Gethin Anthony]] in the television adaption of the series of books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/05/gethin-anthony-aquarius|title=Gethin Anthony on Going from Game of Thrones to the Mind of Charles Manson|work=Vanityfair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gethin Anthony on his character:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reason why I like playing him is I think he's a fantastic man who believes in Westeros being a cultured and enlightened place. His major advantage -- and why he gets on well in the world -- is that he gets on well with people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/game-thrones-gethin-anthony-1046569/|title=Game of Thrones' Gethin Anthony Discusses Renly's Rise, Relationships and Shaving Scene|work=TVGuide|first=Hanh|last=Nguyen|accessdate=March 25, 2016|date=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Renly Baratheon, [[Lord]] of Storm's End, is the youngest brother of King Robert and Master of Laws in the Small Council. He is popular with the people because he is handsome, jovial, and throws extravagant balls and masquerades. He is not fond of fighting or bloodshed, and would rather make friends than kill enemies. He is secretly the lover of Ser [[Loras Tyrell]], the Knight of the Flowers, who convinces him that those qualities make him better ruling material than either of his older brothers. While Robert lies dying, Renly attempts to convince Ned of this, and that the two of them should kidnap Joffrey and rule the realm themselves. However, Ned refuses, so Renly, Loras, and their followers flee south. Once Joffrey becomes King and has Ned executed, Renly challenges his nephew's claim to the throne. Renly declares himself King of the Seven Kingdoms during Season 2 and wins the support of the Baratheon bannermen and the support of other houses, despite Stannis's better claim. He also seals an alliance with the powerful House Tyrell and its bannermen (including Randyll Tarly, father of [[Samwell Tarly]]) by marrying Margaery Tyrell. He leads his massive army slowly through southern Westeros, biding his time. Catelyn Stark tries to convince Renly and Stannis to put aside their differences and unite against the Lannisters but it fails as both brothers refuse to give their claim for the throne. On the night before a battle between his and Stannis's forces, Renly agrees to Catelyn to allow Robb Stark to keep the title &quot;King in the North&quot; and rule the North and Riverlands, but on the condition that he swear fealty to Renly as King on the Iron Throne. Before Catelyn can offer a real negotiation, Renly is assassinated by [[Melisandre]], who gives birth to a shadow demon and sends it to kill Renly in order to remove him from Stannis' path. Stannis is initially unaware of the exact nature of Melisandre's crime, and is later visibly shocked and saddened of the role he played in his brother's death, which he visibly regrets. Renly is later avenged in the [[Mother's Mercy|Season 5 finale]] when Brienne of Tarth executes his brother Stannis after the battle of Winterfell, spitefully telling Stannis that Renly was the rightful King after he confesses his role in Renly's death.

'''''Macbeth''''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|k|ˈ|b|ɛ|θ}}; full title '''''The Tragedy of Macbeth''''') is a [[Shakespearean tragedy|tragedy]] by [[William Shakespeare]]; it is thought to have been first performed in [[1606 in literature|1606]].{{efn|For the first performance in 1606, see {{harvnb|Gurr|2009|p=293}}, {{harvnb|Thomson|1992|p=64}}, and {{harvnb|Wickham|1969|p=231}}. For the date of composition, see {{harvnb|Brooke|2008|p=1}} and {{harvnb|Clark|Mason|2015|p=13}}}} It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake. Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the [[Jacobean era|reign of James I]], who was patron of Shakespeare's [[playing company|acting company]], ''Macbeth'' most clearly reflects the playwright's relationship with his sovereign.{{sfn|Wickham|1969|p=231}} It was first published in the [[First Folio|Folio of 1623]], possibly from a [[prompt book]], and is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy.{{sfn|Clark|Mason|2015|p=1}}

A brave Scottish general named [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth]] receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become [[King of Scotland]]. Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife, Macbeth murders King Duncan and takes the Scottish throne for himself. He is then wracked with guilt and paranoia. Forced to commit more and more murders to protect himself from enmity and suspicion, he soon becomes a tyrannical ruler. The bloodbath and consequent civil war swiftly take Macbeth and Lady Macbeth into the realms of madness and death.

Shakespeare's source for the story is the account of [[Macbeth, King of Scotland]]; [[Macduff (Macbeth)|Macduff]]; and [[Duncan I of Scotland|Duncan]] in ''[[Holinshed's Chronicles]]'' (1587), a history of England, Scotland, and Ireland familiar to Shakespeare and his contemporaries, although the events in the play differ extensively from the history of the real Macbeth. The events of the tragedy are usually associated with the execution of [[Henry Garnet]] for complicity in the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605.{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=41}}

In the backstage world of theatre, some believe that the play is cursed, and will not mention its title aloud, referring to it instead as &quot;[[The Scottish Play]]&quot;. Over the course of many centuries, the play has attracted some of the most renowned actors to the roles of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. It has been adapted to film, television, [[Macbeth (opera)|opera]], novels, comics, and other media.

==Plot==
[[File:MacbethAndBanquo-Witches.jpg|thumb|Macbeth and Banquo encounter the witches for the first time]]

===Act I===

The play opens amidst thunder and lightning, and the Three Witches decide that their next meeting shall be with Macbeth. In the following scene, a wounded sergeant reports to King Duncan of Scotland that his generals{{mdash}}Macbeth, who is the Thane of Glamis, and Banquo{{mdash}}have just defeated the allied forces of Norway and Ireland, who were led by the traitorous Macdonwald, and the Thane of [[Cawdor]]. Macbeth, the King's kinsman, is praised for his bravery and fighting prowess.

In the following scene, Macbeth and Banquo discuss the weather and their victory. As they wander onto a heath, the Three Witches enter and greet them with prophecies. Though Banquo challenges them first, they address Macbeth, hailing him as &quot;Thane of Glamis,&quot; &quot;Thane of Cawdor,&quot; and that he shall &quot;be King hereafter.&quot; Macbeth appears to be stunned to silence. When Banquo asks of his own fortunes, the witches respond paradoxically, saying that he will be less than Macbeth, yet happier, less successful, yet more. He will father a line of kings though he himself will not be one.  While the two men wonder at these pronouncements, the witches vanish, and another thane, [[Ross]], arrives and informs Macbeth of his newly bestowed title: Thane of Cawdor. The first prophecy is thus fulfilled, and Macbeth, previously sceptical, immediately begins to harbour ambitions of becoming king.

King Duncan welcomes and praises Macbeth and Banquo, and declares that he will spend the night at Macbeth's castle at [[Inverness]]; he also names his son Malcolm as his heir. Macbeth sends a message ahead to his wife, Lady Macbeth, telling her about the witches' prophecies. Lady Macbeth suffers none of her husband's uncertainty and wishes him to murder Duncan in order to obtain kingship. When Macbeth arrives at Inverness, she overrides all of her husband's objections by challenging his manhood and successfully persuades him to kill the king that very night. He and Lady Macbeth plan to get Duncan's two chamberlains drunk so that they will black out; the next morning they will blame the chamberlains for the murder. They will be defenceless as they will remember nothing.

===Act II===

While Duncan is asleep, Macbeth stabs him, despite his doubts and a number of supernatural portents, including a hallucination of a bloody dagger. He is so shaken that Lady Macbeth has to take charge. In accordance with her plan, she frames Duncan's sleeping servants for the murder by placing bloody daggers on them. Early the next morning, Lennox, a Scottish nobleman, and Macduff, the loyal Thane of [[Fife]], arrive. A porter opens the gate and Macbeth leads them to the king's chamber, where Macduff discovers Duncan's body. Macbeth murders the guards to prevent them from professing their innocence, but claims he did so in a fit of anger over their misdeeds. Duncan's sons Malcolm and Donalbain flee to England and Ireland, respectively, fearing that whoever killed Duncan desires their demise as well. The rightful heirs' flight makes them suspects and Macbeth assumes the throne as the new [[King of Scotland]] as a kinsman of the dead king. Banquo reveals this to the audience, and while sceptical of the new King Macbeth, he remembers the witches' prophecy about how his own descendants would inherit the throne; this makes him suspicious of Macbeth.

[[File:Banquo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Théodore Chassériau]] (1819–1856), ''Macbeth seeing the Ghost of Banquo,'' 1854]]

===Act III===

Despite his success, Macbeth, also aware of this part of the prophecy, remains uneasy. Macbeth invites Banquo to a royal [[banquet]], where he discovers that Banquo and his young son, Fleance, will be riding out that night. Fearing Banquo's suspicions, Macbeth arranges to have him murdered, by hiring two men to kill them, later sending a [[Third Murderer]]. The assassins succeed in killing Banquo, but Fleance escapes. Macbeth becomes furious: he fears that his power remains insecure as long as an heir of Banquo remains alive.

At a banquet, Macbeth invites his lords and Lady Macbeth to a night of drinking and merriment. Banquo's [[Ghosts in European culture|ghost]] enters and sits in Macbeth's place. Macbeth raves fearfully, startling his guests, as the ghost is only visible to himself. The others panic at the sight of Macbeth raging at an empty chair, until a desperate Lady Macbeth tells them that her husband is merely afflicted with a familiar and harmless malady. The ghost departs and returns once more, causing the same riotous anger and fear in Macbeth. This time, Lady Macbeth tells the lords to leave, and they do so.

[[File:Macbeth consulting the Vision of the Armed Head.jpg|thumb|upright|''Macbeth consulting the Vision of the Armed Head'' by [[Henry Fuseli|Johann Heinrich Füssli]]]]

===Act IV===

Macbeth, disturbed, visits the three witches once more and asks them to reveal the truth of their prophecies to him. To answer his questions, they summon horrible apparitions, each of which offers predictions and further prophecies to put Macbeth's fears at rest. First, they conjure an armoured head, which tells him to beware of Macduff (IV.i.72). Second, a bloody child tells him that no one born of a woman shall be able to harm him. Thirdly, a crowned child holding a tree states that Macbeth will be safe until [[Birnam, Perth and Kinross|Great Birnam Wood]] comes to [[Dunsinane Hill]]. Macbeth is relieved and feels secure because he knows that all men are born of women and forests cannot move. Macbeth also asks whether Banquo's sons will ever reign in Scotland: the witches conjure a procession of eight crowned kings, all similar in appearance to Banquo, and the last carrying a mirror that reflects even more kings. Macbeth realises that these are all Banquo's descendants having acquired kingship in numerous countries. After the witches perform a mad dance and leave, Lennox enters and tells Macbeth that Macduff has fled to England. Macbeth orders Macduff's castle be seized, and, most cruelly, sends murderers to slaughter Macduff, as well as Macduff's wife and children. Although Macduff is no longer in the castle, everyone in Macduff's castle is put to death, including [[Lady Macduff]] and [[Macduff's son|their young son]].

[[File:Johann Heinrich Füssli 030.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Lady Macbeth sleepwalking'' by [[Henry Fuseli|Johann Heinrich Füssli]]]]

===Act V===

Meanwhile, Lady Macbeth becomes racked with guilt from the crimes she and her husband have committed. At night, in the king's palace at Dunsinane, a doctor and a gentlewoman discuss Lady Macbeth's strange habit of sleepwalking. Suddenly, Lady Macbeth enters in a trance with a candle in her hand. Bemoaning the murders of Duncan, Lady Macduff, and Banquo, she tries to wash off imaginary bloodstains from her hands, all the while speaking of the terrible things she knows she pressed her husband to do. She leaves, and the doctor and gentlewoman marvel at her descent into madness. Her belief that nothing can wash away the blood on her hands is an ironic reversal of her earlier claim to Macbeth that &quot;[a] little water clears us of this deed&quot; (II.ii.66).

In England, Macduff is informed by Ross that his &quot;castle is surprised; wife and babes / Savagely slaughter'd&quot; (IV.iii.204–05). When this news of his family's execution reaches him, Macduff is stricken with grief and vows revenge. Prince Malcolm, Duncan's son, has succeeded in raising an army in England, and Macduff joins him as he rides to Scotland to challenge Macbeth's forces. The invasion has the support of the Scottish nobles, who are appalled and frightened by Macbeth's tyrannical and murderous behaviour. Malcolm leads an army, along with Macduff and Englishmen [[Sigurd the Dane|Siward]] (the Elder), the [[Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]], against Dunsinane Castle. While encamped in Birnam Wood, the soldiers are ordered to cut down and carry tree limbs to camouflage their numbers.

Before Macbeth's opponents arrive, he receives news that Lady Macbeth has killed herself, causing him to sink into a deep and pessimistic despair and deliver his &quot;[[Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow]]&quot; [[soliloquy]] (V.v.17–28). Though he reflects on the brevity and meaninglessness of life, he nevertheless awaits the English and fortifies Dunsinane. He is certain that the witches' prophecies guarantee his invincibility, but is struck with fear when he learns that the English army is advancing on Dunsinane shielded with boughs cut from Birnam Wood, in apparent fulfillment of one of the prophecies.

A battle culminates in Macduff's confrontation with Macbeth, who kills Young Siward in combat. The English forces overwhelm his army and castle. Macbeth boasts that he has no reason to fear Macduff, for he cannot be killed by any man born of woman. Macduff declares that he was &quot;from his mother's womb / Untimely ripp'd&quot; (V.8.15–16), (i.e., born by [[Caesarean section]]) and is not &quot;of woman born&quot; (an example of a [[quibble (plot device)|literary quibble]]), fulfilling the second prophecy. Macbeth realises too late that he has misinterpreted the witches' words. Though he realises that he is doomed, he continues to fight. Macduff kills and beheads him, thus fulfilling the remaining prophecy.

Macduff carries Macbeth's head onstage and Malcolm discusses how order has been restored. His last reference to Lady Macbeth, however, reveals &quot;'tis thought, by self and violent hands / Took off her life&quot; (V.ix.71–72), but the method of her suicide is undisclosed. Malcolm, now the King of Scotland, declares his benevolent intentions for the country and invites all to see him crowned at [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]].

Although Malcolm, and not Fleance, is placed on the throne, the witches' prophecy concerning Banquo (&quot;Thou shalt get kings&quot;) was known to the audience of Shakespeare's time to be true: James VI of Scotland (later also [[James VI and I|James I of England]]) was supposedly a descendant of Banquo.{{sfn|Muir|1984|p=xxxvi}}

A principal source comes from the ''[[Daemonologie]]'' of [[James VI and I|King James]] published in 1597 which included a news pamphlet titled ''[[Newes from Scotland]]'' that detailed the famous [[North Berwick Witch Trials]] of 1590. The publication of ''Daemonologie'' came just a few years before the tragedy of ''Macbeth'' with the themes and setting in a direct and comparative contrast with King James' personal experiences with witchcraft. Not only had this trial taken place in Scotland, the witches involved were recorded to have also conducted rituals with the same mannerisms as the three witches. One of the evidenced passages is referenced when the witches involved in the trial confessed to attempt the use of witchcraft to raise a tempest and sabotage the very boat King James and his queen were on board during their return trip from [[Denmark]]. This was significant as one ship sailing with King James' fleet actually sank in the storm. The following quote from ''Macbeth'' is one such reference:{{sfn|Warren|2016|p=107}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;purposely to be cassin into the sea to raise winds for destruction of ships.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Macbeth'', I.III.15–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Macbeth'' has been compared to Shakespeare's ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]].'' Both Antony and Macbeth as characters seek a new world, even at the cost of the old one. Both are fighting for a throne and have a 'nemesis' to face to achieve that throne. For Antony, the nemesis is Octavius; for Macbeth, it is Banquo. At one point Macbeth even compares himself to Antony, saying &quot;under Banquo / My Genius is rebuk'd, as it is said / Mark Antony's was by Caesar.&quot; Lastly, both plays contain powerful and manipulative female figures: Cleopatra and Lady Macbeth.{{sfn|Coursen|1997|pp=11–13}}

Shakespeare borrowed the story from several tales in ''[[Holinshed's Chronicles]]'', a popular history of the British Isles well known to Shakespeare and his contemporaries. In ''Chronicles'', a man named Donwald finds several of his family put to death by his king, [[Dub, King of Scotland|King Duff]], for dealing with witches. After being pressured by his wife, he and four of his servants kill the King in his own house. In ''Chronicles'', Macbeth is portrayed as struggling to support the kingdom in the face of King Duncan's ineptitude. He and Banquo meet the three witches, who make exactly the same prophecies as in Shakespeare's version. Macbeth and Banquo then together plot the murder of Duncan, at Lady Macbeth's urging. Macbeth has a long, ten-year reign before eventually being overthrown by Macduff and Malcolm. The parallels between the two versions are clear. However, some scholars think that [[George Buchanan]]'s ''[[Rerum Scoticarum Historia]]'' matches Shakespeare's version more closely. Buchanan's work was available in Latin in Shakespeare's day.{{sfn|Coursen|1997|pp=15–21}}

No other version of the story has Macbeth kill the king in Macbeth's own castle. Scholars have seen this change of Shakespeare's as adding to the darkness of Macbeth's crime as the worst violation of hospitality. Versions of the story that were common at the time had Duncan being killed in an ambush at [[Inverness]], not in a castle. Shakespeare conflated the story of Donwald and King Duff in what was a significant change to the story.{{sfn|Coursen|1997|p=17}}

Shakespeare made another important change. In ''Chronicles'', Banquo is an accomplice in Macbeth's murder of King Duncan, and plays an important part in ensuring that Macbeth, not Malcolm, takes the throne in the coup that follows.{{sfn|Nagarajan|1956}} In Shakespeare's day, Banquo was thought to be an ancestor of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] King James I.{{sfn|Palmer|1886}} (In the 19th century it was established that Banquo is an unhistorical character, the Stuarts are actually descended from a Breton family which migrated to Scotland slightly later than Macbeth's time.)  The Banquo portrayed in earlier sources is significantly different from the Banquo created by Shakespeare. Critics have proposed several reasons for this change. First, to portray the king's ancestor as a murderer would have been risky. Other authors of the time who wrote about Banquo, such as [[Jean de Schelandre]] in his ''Stuartide'', also changed history by portraying Banquo as a noble man, not a murderer, probably for the same reasons.{{sfn|Maskell|1971}} Second, Shakespeare may have altered Banquo's character simply because there was no dramatic need for another accomplice to the murder; there was, however, a need to give a dramatic contrast to Macbeth—a role which many scholars argue is filled by Banquo.{{sfn|Nagarajan|1956}}

Other scholars maintain that a strong argument can be made for associating the tragedy with the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605.{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=41}} As presented by Harold Bloom in 2008: &quot;[S]cholars cite the existence of several topical references in ''Macbeth'' to the events of that year, namely the execution of the Rev. Henry Garnett for his alleged complicity in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, as referenced in the porter's scene.&quot;{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=41}}

==Date and text==
''Macbeth'' cannot be dated precisely but it is usually dated as contemporaneous to the other canonical tragedies (''King Lear'', ''Hamlet'', and ''Othello'').{{sfn|Wells|Taylor|2005|pp=909, 1153}} Some scholars have placed the original writing of the play as early as 1599.{{sfn|Bloom|2008|p=41}} As the play is widely seen to celebrate King James' ancestors and the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] accession to the throne in 1603 (James believed himself to be descended from [[Banquo]]),{{sfn|Braunmuller|1997|pp=2–3}} most scholars believe that the play is unlikely to have been composed earlier than 1603 and suggest that the parade of eight kings—which the witches show Macbeth in a vision in Act IV—is a compliment to King James. Many scholars think the play was written in 1606 in the aftermath of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] because of possible internal allusions to the 1605 plot and its ensuing trials.{{sfn|Brooke|2008|pp=59–64}} In fact, there are a great number of allusions and possible pieces of evidence alluding to the Plot, and, for this reason, a great many critics agree that ''Macbeth'' was written in the year 1606.{{sfn|Wills|1996|p=7}}{{sfn|Muir|1985|p=48}}{{sfn|Taylor|Jowett|1993|p=85}} Lady Macbeth's instructions to her husband, &quot;Look like the innocent flower, but be the serpent under't&quot; (1.5.74–75), may be an allusion to a medal that was struck in 1605 to commemorate King James' escape that depicted a serpent hiding among lilies and roses.{{sfn|Paul|1950|p=227}}

Particularly, the Porter's speech (2.3.1–21) in which he welcomes an &quot;equivocator&quot;, a farmer, and a tailor to hell (2.3.8–13), has been argued to be an allusion to the 28 March 1606 trial and execution on 3 May 1606 of the Jesuit [[Henry Garnet]], who used the alias &quot;Farmer&quot;, with &quot;equivocator&quot; referring to Garnet's defence of [[Mental reservation|&quot;equivocation&quot;]].{{sfn|Kermode|1974|p=1308}}{{sfn|Braunmuller|1997|pp=5–8}}{{efn|For details on Garnet, see Perez Zagorin's article, &quot;The Historical Significance of Lying and Dissimulation&quot; (1996), in ''[[Social Research]]''.{{sfn|Zagorin|1996}}}} The porter says that the equivocator &quot;committed treason enough for God's sake&quot; (2.3.9–10), which specifically connects equivocation and treason and ties it to the Jesuit belief that equivocation was only lawful when used &quot;for God's sake&quot;, strengthening the allusion to Garnet. The porter goes on to say that the equivocator &quot;yet could not equivocate to heaven&quot; (2.3.10–11), echoing grim jokes that were current on the eve of Garnet's execution: i.e. that Garnet would be &quot;hanged without equivocation&quot; and at his execution he was asked &quot;not to equivocate with his last breath.&quot;{{sfn|Rogers|1965|pp=44–45}} The &quot;English tailor&quot; the porter admits to hell (2.3.13), has been seen as an allusion to Hugh Griffin, a tailor who was questioned by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] on 27 November and 3 December 1607 for the part he played in Garnet's &quot;miraculous straw&quot;, an infamous head of straw that was stained with Garnet's blood that had congealed into a form resembling Garnet's portrait, which was hailed by Catholics as a miracle. The tailor Griffin became notorious and the subject of verses published with his portrait on the title page.{{sfn|Rogers|1965|pp=45–47}}

When James became king of England, a feeling of uncertainty settled over the nation. James was a Scottish king and the son of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], a staunch Catholic and English traitor. In the words of critic [[Robert Crawford (Scottish poet)|Robert Crawford]], &quot;''Macbeth'' was a play for a post-Elizabethan England facing up to what it might mean to have a Scottish king. England seems comparatively benign, while its northern neighbour is mired in a bloody, monarch-killing past. … ''Macbeth'' may have been set in medieval Scotland, but it was filled with material of interest to England and England's ruler.&quot;{{sfn|Crawford|2010}} Critics argue that the content of the play is clearly a message to James, the new Scottish King of England. Garry Wills provides further evidence that ''Macbeth'' is a Gunpowder Play (a type of play that emerged immediately following the events of the Gunpowder Plot). He points out that every Gunpowder Play contains &quot;a necromancy scene, regicide attempted or completed, references to equivocation, scenes that test loyalty by use of deceptive language, and a character who sees through plots—along with a vocabulary similar to the Plot in its immediate aftermath (words like ''train, blow, vault'') and an ironic recoil of the Plot upon the Plotters (who fall into the pit they dug).&quot;{{sfn|Wills|1996|p=7}}

The play utilizes a few key words that the audience at the time would recognize as allusions to the Plot. In one sermon in 1605, [[Lancelot Andrewes]] stated, regarding the failure of the Plotters on God's day, &quot;Be they fair or foul, glad or sad (as the poet calleth Him) the great Diespiter, 'the Father of days' hath made them both.&quot;{{sfn|Harris|2007|pp=473–474}} Shakespeare begins the play by using the words &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;foul&quot; in the first speeches of the witches and Macbeth. In the words of Jonathan Gil Harris, the play expresses the &quot;horror unleashed by a supposedly loyal subject who seeks to kill a king and the treasonous role of equivocation. The play even echoes certain keywords from the scandal – the 'vault' beneath the House of Parliament in which Guy Fawkes stored thirty kegs of gunpowder and the 'blow' about which one of the conspirators had secretly warned a relative who planned to attend the House of Parliament on 5 November...Even though the Plot is never alluded to directly, its presence is everywhere in the play, like a pervasive odor.&quot;{{sfn|Harris|2007|pp=473–474}}

[[File:Second Folio Title Page of Macbeth.jpg|thumb|left|The first page of ''Macbeth'', printed in the Second Folio of 1632]]
Scholars also cite an entertainment seen by King James at [[Oxford]] in the summer of 1605 that featured three &quot;[[sibyl]]s&quot; like the weird sisters; Kermode surmises that Shakespeare could have heard about this and alluded to it with the weird sisters.{{sfn|Kermode|1974|p=1308}} However, A. R. Braunmuller in the New Cambridge edition finds the 1605–06 arguments inconclusive, and argues only for an earliest date of 1603.{{sfn|Braunmuller|1997|pp=5–8}}

One suggested allusion supporting a date in late 1606 is the first witch's dialogue about a sailor's wife: &quot;'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries./Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the ''Tiger''&quot; (1.3.6–7). This has been thought to allude to the ''Tiger'', a ship that returned to England 27 June 1606 after a disastrous voyage in which many of the crew were killed by pirates. A few lines later the witch speaks of the sailor, &quot;He shall live a man forbid:/Weary se'nnights nine times nine&quot; (1.3.21–22). The real ship was at sea 567 days, the product of 7x9x9, which has been taken as a confirmation of the allusion, which if correct, confirms that the witch scenes were either written or amended later than July 1606.{{sfn|Loomis|1956}}{{sfn|Brooke|2008|pp=59–64}}

The play is not considered to have been written any later than 1607, since, as Kermode notes, there are &quot;fairly clear allusions to the play in 1607.&quot;{{sfn|Kermode|1974|p=1308}} One notable reference is in [[Francis Beaumont]]'s ''[[Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'', first performed in 1607.{{sfn|Whitted|2012}}{{sfn|Smith|2012}} The following lines (Act V, Scene 1, 24–30) are, according to scholars,{{sfn|Dyce|1843|p=216}}{{sfn|Sprague|1889|p=12}} a clear allusion to the scene in which Banquo's ghost haunts Macbeth at the dinner table:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
When thou art at thy table with thy friends,
Merry in heart, and filled with swelling wine,
I'll come in midst of all thy pride and mirth,
Invisible to all men but thyself,
And whisper such a sad tale in thine ear
Shall make thee let the cup fall from thy hand,
And stand as mute and pale as death itself.{{sfn|Hattaway|1969|p=100}}&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Macbeth'' was first printed in the [[First Folio]] of 1623 and the Folio is the only source for the text. Some scholars contend that the Folio text was abridged and rearranged from an earlier manuscript or prompt book.{{sfn|Clark|Mason|2015|p=321}} Often cited as interpolation are stage cues for two songs, whose lyrics are not included in the Folio but are included in [[Thomas Middleton]]'s play ''[[The Witch (play)|The Witch]]'', which was written between the accepted date for ''Macbeth'' (1606) and the printing of the Folio.{{sfn|Clark|Mason|2015|p=325}} Many scholars believe these songs were editorially inserted into the Folio, though whether they were Middleton's songs or preexisting songs is not certain.{{sfn|Clark|Mason|2015|pp=326–329}} It is also widely believed that the character of [[Hecate#Hecate in literature|Hecate]], as well as some lines of the First Witch (4.1 124–31), were not part of Shakespeare's original play but were added by the Folio editors and possibly written by Middleton,{{sfn|Brooke|2008|p=57}} though &quot;there is no completely objective proof&quot; of such interpolation.{{sfn|Clark|Mason|2015|pp=329–335}}

== Pronunciations ==
The 'reconstructive movement' was concerned with the recreation of Elizabethan acting conditions, and would eventually lead to the creation of [[Shakespeare's Globe]] and similar replicas. One of the movement's offshoots was in the reconstruction of Elizabethan pronunciation: for example [[Bernard Miles]]' 1951 ''Macbeth'', for which linguists from [[University College London]] were employed to create a transcript of the play in Elizabethan&lt;!-- This is the term used in the source: I don't think the slight anachronism (Elizabeth died before Macbeth was written) needs any comment or correction in the body text. --&gt; English, then an audio recording of that transcription, from which the actors, in turn, learned their lines.{{sfn|O'Connor|2002|pp=83, 92–93}}

The pronunciation of many words evolves over time. In Shakespeare's day, for example, &quot;heath&quot; was pronounced as &quot;heth&quot; (&quot;or a slightly elongated 'e' as in the modern 'get'&quot;){{sfn|Papadinis|2012|p=31}}, so it rhymed with &quot;Macbeth&quot; in the sentences by the Witches at the beginning of the play:{{sfn|Price|2014}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Second Witch''': Upon the heath.&lt;br /&gt;'''Third Witch''': There to meet with Macbeth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A scholar of antique pronunciation writes, &quot;''Heath'' would have made a close (if not exact) rhyme with the &quot;-eth&quot; of ''Macbeth'', which was pronounced with a short 'i' as in 'it'.&quot;{{sfn|Papadinis|2012|p=31}}

In the theatre programme notes, &quot;much was made of how OP [Original Pronunciation] performance reintroduces lost rhymes such as the final couplet: 'So thanks to all at once, and each to one, / Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone'&quot; (5.11.40–41) where 'one' sounds like 'own'. The Witches, the play's great purveyors of rhyme, benefited most in this regard. So, 'babe' (4.1.30) sounded like 'bab' and rhymed with 'drab' (4.1.31)...&quot;{{sfn|Price|2014}}

Eoin Price wrote, &quot;I found the OP rendition of Banquo's brilliant question 'Or have we eaten on the insane root / That takes the raison prisoner?' unduly amusing&quot;; and he adds,

&lt;blockquote&gt;:... 'fear' had two pronunciations: the standard modern pronunciation being one, and 'fair' being the other. Mostly, the actors seemed to pronounce it in a way which accords with the modern standard, but during one speech, Macbeth said 'fair'. This seems especially significant in a play determined to complicate the relationship between 'fair' and 'foul'. I wonder, then, if the punning could be extended throughout the production. Would Banquo's lines, 'Good sir, why do you start and seem to fear / Things that do sound so fair?' (1.3.49–50) be fascinatingly illuminated, or merely muddled, by this punning? Perhaps this is a possibility the cast already experimented with and chose to discard, but, for sure, an awareness of the possibility of a 'fair/fear' pun can have interesting ramifications for the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bloggingshakespeare.com/reviewing-shakespeare/macbeth-original-pronunciation-shakespeares-globe-sam-wanamaker-playhouse-2014/ |title=''Macbeth'' in Original Pronunciation (Shakespeare's Globe) @ Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, 2014 |last=Price |first=Eoin |date=2014 |website=Reviewing Shakespeare |publisher=Blogging Shakespeare |access-date=25 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Macbeth'' is an anomaly among Shakespeare's tragedies in certain critical ways. It is short: more than a thousand lines shorter than ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[King Lear]]'', and only slightly more than half as long as ''[[Hamlet]]''. This brevity has suggested to many critics that the received version is based on a heavily cut source, perhaps a prompt-book for a particular performance. This would reflect other Shakespearean plays existing in both Quarto and the Folio, where the Quarto versions are usually longer than the Folio versions. ''Macbeth'' was first printed in the First Folio, but has no Quarto version - if there were a Quarto, it would probably be longer than the Folio version. &lt;ref&gt;Bradley, AC, ''Shakespearean Tragedy''&lt;/ref&gt;That brevity has also been connected to other unusual features: the fast pace of the first act, which has seemed to be &quot;stripped for action&quot;; the comparative flatness of the characters other than Macbeth;{{sfn|Stoll|1943|p=26}}&lt;!-- Arthur Quiller-Couch, cited in Stoll, discusses this at more length. --&gt; and the oddness of Macbeth himself compared with other Shakespearean tragic heroes.{{clarify|reason=Why is he odd? Needs elaboration|date=September 2014}} [[AC Bradley]], in considering this question, concluded the play &quot;always was an extremely short one&quot;, noting the witch scenes and battle scenes would have taken up some time in performance, remarking, &quot;I do not think that, in reading, we ''feel'' Macbeth to be short: certainly we are astonished when we hear it is about half as long as ''Hamlet''. Perhaps in the Shakespearean theatre too it seemed to occupy a longer time than the clock recorded.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, AC, ''Shakespearean Tragedy''&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a tragedy of character===
At least since the days of [[Alexander Pope]] and [[Samuel Johnson]], analysis of the play has centred on the question of Macbeth's ambition, commonly seen as so dominant a trait that it defines the character.{{cn|date=February 2018}} Johnson asserted that Macbeth, though esteemed for his military bravery, is wholly reviled.{{cn|date=February 2018}} This opinion recurs in critical literature, and, according to [[Caroline Spurgeon]], is supported by Shakespeare himself, who apparently intended to degrade his hero by vesting him with clothes unsuited to him and to make Macbeth look ridiculous by several [[nimism]]s he applies: His garments seem either too big or too small for him&amp;nbsp;– as his ambition is too big and his character too small for his new and unrightful role as king. When he feels as if &quot;dressed in borrowed robes&quot;, after his new title as Thane of Cawdor, prophesied by the witches, has been confirmed by Ross (I, 3, ll. 108–09), Banquo comments: &quot;New honours come upon him, / Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould, / But with the aid of use&quot; (I, 3, ll. 145–46). And, at the end, when the tyrant is at bay at Dunsinane, Caithness sees him as a man trying in vain to fasten a large garment on him with too small a belt: &quot;He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause / Within the belt of rule&quot; (V, 2, ll. 14–15), while Angus, in a similar nimism, sums up what everybody thinks ever since Macbeth's accession to power: &quot;now does he feel his title / Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe / upon a dwarfish thief&quot; (V, 2, ll. 18–20).{{sfn|Spurgeon|1935|pp=324–327}}

Like [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], but without that character's perversely appealing exuberance, Macbeth wades through blood until his inevitable fall. As Kenneth Muir writes, &quot;Macbeth has not a predisposition to murder; he has merely an inordinate ambition that makes murder itself seem to be a lesser evil than failure to achieve the crown.&quot;{{Sfn|Muir|1984|p=xlviii}} Some critics, such as E. E. Stoll, explain this characterisation as a holdover from Senecan or medieval tradition. Shakespeare's audience, in this view, expected villains to be wholly bad, and Senecan style, far from prohibiting a villainous protagonist, all but demanded it.{{sfn|Stoll|1943|p=26}}&lt;!-- Stoll doesn't make this connection explicit: he discusses Macbeth as a tragic hero that commits villainous acts, and discusses Aristotelan (Senecan, in practice) primacy of plot over character (Stoll is responding to psychological readings), but doesn't, here, say that Shakespeare was writing to an audience expectation of a villainous protagonist. He makes that connection elsewhere though (From Shakespeare to Joyce, Shakespeare and Other Masters). --&gt;

Yet for other critics, it has not been so easy to resolve the question of Macbeth's motivation. [[Robert Bridges]], for instance, perceived a paradox: a character able to express such convincing horror before Duncan's murder would likely be incapable of committing the crime.{{cn|date=February 2018}} For many critics, Macbeth's motivations in the first act appear vague and insufficient. [[John Dover Wilson]] hypothesised that Shakespeare's original text had an extra scene or scenes where husband and wife discussed their plans.{{cn|date=February 2018}} This interpretation is not fully provable; however, the motivating role of ambition for Macbeth is universally recognised. The evil actions motivated by his ambition seem to trap him in a cycle of increasing evil, as Macbeth himself recognises: &quot;I am in blood/Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,/Returning were as tedious as go o'er.&quot;{{cn|date=February 2018}}

While working on Russian translations of Shakespeare's works, [[Boris Pasternak]] compared Macbeth to [[Raskolnikov]], the protagonist of ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' by [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]. Pasternak argues that &quot;neither Macbeth or Raskolnikov is a born criminal or a villain by nature. They are turned into criminals by faulty rationalizations, by deductions from false premises.&quot; He goes on to argue that Lady Macbeth is &quot;feminine&amp;nbsp;... one of those active, insistent wives&quot; who becomes her husband's &quot;executive, more resolute and consistent than he is himself.&quot; According to Pasternak, she is only helping Macbeth carry out his own wishes, to her own detriment.{{sfn|Pasternak|1959|pp=150–152}}

===As a tragedy of moral order===
{{uncited-section|date=February 2018}}
The disastrous consequences of Macbeth's ambition are not limited to him. Almost from the moment of the murder, the play depicts Scotland as a land shaken by inversions of the natural order. Shakespeare may have intended a reference to the [[great chain of being]], although the play's images of disorder are mostly not specific enough to support detailed intellectual readings. He may also have intended an elaborate compliment to James's belief in the [[divine right of kings]], although this hypothesis, outlined at greatest length by Henry N. Paul, is not universally accepted. As in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', though, perturbations in the political sphere are echoed and even amplified by events in the material world. Among the most often depicted of the inversions of the natural order is sleep. Macbeth's announcement that he has &quot;murdered sleep&quot; is figuratively mirrored in Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking.

''Macbeth'''s generally accepted indebtedness to medieval tragedy is often seen as significant in the play's treatment of moral order. Glynne Wickham connects the play, through the Porter, to a [[mystery play]] on the [[harrowing of hell]]. Howard Felperin argues that the play has a more complex attitude toward &quot;orthodox Christian tragedy&quot; than is often admitted; he sees a kinship between the play and the [[Herod the Great|tyrant plays]] within the medieval liturgical drama.

The theme of androgyny is often seen as a special aspect of the theme of disorder. Inversion of normative gender roles is most famously associated with the witches and with Lady Macbeth as she appears in the first act. Whatever Shakespeare's degree of sympathy with such inversions, the play ends with a thorough return to normative gender values. Some [[feminist literary criticism|feminist]] [[psychoanalytic literary criticism|psychoanalytic]] critics, such as Janet Adelman, have connected the play's treatment of gender roles to its larger theme of inverted natural order. In this light, Macbeth is punished for his violation of the moral order by being removed from the cycles of nature (which are figured as female); nature itself (as embodied in the movement of Birnam Wood) is part of the restoration of moral order.

===As a poetic tragedy===
Critics in the early twentieth century reacted against what they saw as an excessive dependence on the study of character in criticism of the play. This dependence, though most closely associated with [[Andrew Cecil Bradley]], is clear as early as the time of [[Mary Cowden Clarke]], who offered precise, if fanciful, accounts of the predramatic lives of Shakespeare's female leads. She suggested, for instance, that the child Lady Macbeth refers to in the first act died during a foolish military action.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

===Witchcraft and evil===
[[File:Macbeth and Banquo with the witches JHF.jpg|thumb|''Macbeth and Banquo with the Witches'' by [[Henry Fuseli]]]]

In the play, the Three Witches represent darkness, chaos, and conflict, while their role is as agents and witnesses.{{sfn|Kliman|Santos|2005|p=14}} Their presence communicates treason and impending doom. During Shakespeare's day, witches were seen as worse than rebels, &quot;the most notorious traytor and rebell that can be.&quot;{{sfn|Perkins|1610|p=53}} They were not only political traitors, but spiritual traitors as well. Much of the confusion that springs from them comes from their ability to straddle the play's borders between reality and the supernatural. They are so deeply entrenched in both worlds that it is unclear whether they control fate, or whether they are merely its agents. They defy logic, not being subject to the rules of the real world.{{sfn|Coddon|1989|p=491}} The witches' lines in the first act: &quot;Fair is foul, and foul is fair: Hover through the fog and filthy air&quot; are often said to set the tone for the rest of the play by establishing a sense of confusion. Indeed, the play is filled with situations where evil is depicted as good, while good is rendered evil. The line &quot;Double, double toil and trouble,&quot; communicates the witches' intent clearly: they seek only trouble for the mortals around them.{{sfn|Frye|1987}}{{pn|date=January 2018}} The witches' spells are remarkably similar to the spells of the witch Medusa in Anthony Munday's play ''[[Fidele and Fortunio]]'' published in 1584, and Shakespeare may have been influenced by these.

While the witches do not tell Macbeth directly to kill King Duncan, they use a subtle form of temptation when they tell Macbeth that he is destined to be king. By placing this thought in his mind, they effectively guide him on the path to his own destruction. This follows the pattern of temptation used at the time of Shakespeare. First, they argued, a thought is put in a man's mind, then the person may either indulge in the thought or reject it. Macbeth indulges in it, while Banquo rejects.{{sfn|Frye|1987}}{{pn|date=January 2018}}

According to J. A. Bryant Jr., Macbeth also makes use of Biblical parallels, notably between King Duncan's murder and the murder of [[Christ]]:

{{quote|No matter how one looks at it, whether as history or as tragedy, Macbeth is distinctively Christian. One may simply count the Biblical allusions as Richmond Noble has done; one may go further and study the parallels between Shakespeare's story and the Old Testament stories of [[Saul]] and [[Jezebel]] as Miss Jane H. Jack has done; or one may examine with W. C. Curry the progressive degeneration of Macbeth from the point of view of medieval theology.{{sfn|Bryant|1961|p=153}}|sign=|source=}}

== Superstition and &quot;The Scottish Play&quot; ==
{{Main article|The Scottish Play}}

While many today would say that any misfortune surrounding a production is mere coincidence, actors and other theatre people often consider it bad luck to mention ''Macbeth'' by name while inside a theatre, and sometimes refer to it indirectly, for example as &quot;[[The Scottish Play|the Scottish play]]&quot;,{{sfn|Faires|2000}} or &quot;MacBee&quot;, or when referring to the character and not the play, &quot;Mr. and Mrs. M&quot;, or &quot;The Scottish King&quot;.

This is because Shakespeare (or the play's revisers) are said to have used the spells of real witches in his text, purportedly angering the witches and causing them to curse the play.{{sfn|Tritsch|1984}}{{better source|date=January 2018}} Thus, to say the name of the play inside a theatre is believed to doom the production to failure, and perhaps cause physical injury or death to cast members. There are stories of accidents, misfortunes and even deaths taking place during runs of ''Macbeth''.{{sfn|Faires|2000}}

According to the actor Sir [[Donald Sinden]], in his [[Sky Arts]] TV series ''[[Great West End Theatres]]'', &lt;blockquote&gt;contrary to popular myth, Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth is not the unluckiest play as superstition likes to portray it. Exactly the opposite! The origin of the unfortunate moniker dates back to repertory theatre days when each town and village had at least one theatre to entertain the public. If a play was not doing well, it would invariably get 'pulled' and replaced with a sure-fire audience pleaser – Macbeth guaranteed full-houses. So when the weekly theatre newspaper, ''[[The Stage]]'' was published, listing what was on in each theatre in the country, it was instantly noticed what shows had NOT worked the previous week, as they had been replaced by a definite crowd-pleaser. More actors have died during performances of Hamlet than in the &quot;Scottish play&quot; as the profession still calls it. It is forbidden to quote from it backstage as this could cause the current play to collapse and have to be replaced, causing possible unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;''Great West End Theatres'' Sky Arts. 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- FIXME: this quote is somewhat excessive, and Sir Donald, bless him, is not a particularly scholarly source. --&gt;

Several methods exist to dispel the curse, depending on the actor. One, attributed to [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]], is to immediately leave the building the stage is in with the person who uttered the name, walk around it three times, spit over their left shoulders, say an obscenity then wait to be invited back into the building.{{sfn|Straczynski|2006}}{{pn|date=January 2018}} A related practice is to spin around three times as fast as possible on the spot, sometimes accompanied by spitting over their shoulder, and uttering an obscenity. Another popular &quot;ritual&quot; is to leave the room, knock three times, be invited in, and then quote a line from ''[[Hamlet]]''. Yet another is to recite lines from ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', thought to be a lucky play.{{sfn|Garber|2008|p=77}}

==Legacy==
===Performance history===
====Shakespeare's day to the Interregnum====
The only eyewitness account of ''Macbeth'' in Shakespeare's lifetime was recorded by [[Simon Forman]], who saw a performance at [[Globe Theatre|the Globe]] on 20 April 1610.{{sfn|Brooke|2008|p=36}}{{sfn|Clark|Mason|2015|p=337}} Scholars have noted discrepancies between Forman's account and the play as it appears in the Folio. For example, he makes no mention of the apparition scene, or of Hecate,{{sfn|Clark|Mason|2015|p=324}} of the man not of woman born, or of Birnam Wood.{{sfn|Brooke|2008|p=36}}{{sfn|Orgel|2002|p=33}} However, Clark{{sfn|Clark|Mason|2015|p=301}} observes that Forman's accounts were often inaccurate and incomplete (for instance omitting the statue scene from ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'') and his interest did not seem to be in &quot;giving full accounts of the productions.&quot;{{sfn|Clark|Mason|2015|p=324}}

As mentioned above, the Folio text is thought by some to be an alteration of the original play. This has led to the theory that the play as we know it from the Folio was an adaptation for indoor performance at the [[Blackfriars Theatre]] (which was operated by the King's Men from 1608) – and even speculation that it represents a specific performance before King James.{{sfn|Brooke|2008|pp=34–36}}{{sfn|Orgel|2002|pp=158–161}}{{sfn|Taylor|2002|p=2}} The play contains more musical [[Cue (theatrical)|cues]] than any other play in the canon as well as a significant use of [[sound effect]]s.{{sfn|Brooke|2008|pp=35–36}}

====Restoration and eighteenth century====

{{quote box|width=23em|&quot;The chill of the grave seemed about you when you looked on her; there was the hush and damp of the charnel house at midnight ... your flesh crept and your breathing became uneasy ... the scent of blood became palpable to you.&quot;|—Sheridan Knowles on [[Sarah Siddons]]' sleepwalking scene{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=119}}}}

All theatres were closed down by the [[Puritan]] government on 6 September 1642. Upon the [[English Restoration|restoration]] of the monarchy in 1660, two [[patent theatre|patent companies]] (the [[King's Company]] and the [[Duke's Company]]) were established, and the existing theatrical repertoire divided between them.{{sfn|Marsden|2002|p=21}} [[William Davenant|Sir William Davenant]], founder of the Duke's Company, adapted Shakespeare's play to the tastes of the new era, and his version would dominate on stage for around eighty years. Among the changes he made were the expansion of the role of the witches, introducing new songs, dances and 'flying', and the expansion of the role of Lady Macduff as a foil to Lady Macbeth.{{sfn|Tatspaugh|2003|pp=526–527}} There were, however, performances outside the patent companies: among the evasions of the Duke's Company's monopoly was a puppet version of ''Macbeth''.{{sfn|Lanier|2002|pp=28–29}}

''Macbeth'' was a favourite of the seventeenth-century diarist [[Samuel Pepys]], who saw the play on 5 November 1664 (&quot;admirably acted&quot;), 28 December 1666 (&quot;most excellently acted&quot;), ten days later on 7 January 1667 (&quot;though I saw it lately, yet [it] appears a most excellent play in all respects&quot;), on 19 April 1667 (&quot;one of the best plays for a stage ... that ever I saw&quot;), again on 16 October 1667 (&quot;was vexed to see Young, who is but a bad actor at best, act Macbeth in the room of [[Thomas Betterton|Betterton]], who, poor man! is sick&quot;), and again three weeks later on 6 November 1667 (&quot;[at] ''Macbeth'', which we still like mightily&quot;), yet again on 12 August 1668 (&quot;saw ''Macbeth'', to our great content&quot;), and finally on 21 December 1668, on which date the [[Charles II of England|king]] and court were also present in the audience.{{sfn|Orgel|2002|p=155}}

The first professional performances of ''Macbeth'' in North America were probably those of [[Old American Company|The Hallam Company]].{{sfn|Morrison|2002|pp=231–232}}

In 1744, [[David Garrick]] revived the play, abandoning Davenant's version and instead advertising it &quot;as written by Shakespeare&quot;. In fact this claim was largely false: he retained much of Davenant's more popular business for the witches, and himself wrote a lengthy death speech for Macbeth. And he cut more than 10% of Shakespeare's play, including the drunken porter, the murder of Lady Macduff's son, and Malcolm's testing of Macduff.{{sfn|Orgel|2002|p=246}} [[Hannah Pritchard]] was his greatest stage partner, having her premiere as his Lady Macbeth in 1747. He would later drop the play from his repertoire upon her retirement from the stage.{{sfn|Potter|2001|p=188}} Mrs. Pritchard was the first actress to achieve acclaim in the role of Lady Macbeth – at least partly due to the removal of Davenant's material, which made irrelevant moral contrasts with Lady Macduff.{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=158}} Garrick's portrayal focused on the inner life of the character, endowing him with an innocence vacillating between good and evil, and betrayed by outside influences. He portrayed a man capable of observing himself, as if a part of him remained untouched by what he had done, the play moulding him into a man of sensibility, rather than him descending into a tyrant.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=124}}

[[John Philip Kemble]] first played Macbeth in 1778.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=125}} Although usually regarded as the antithesis of Garrick, Kemble nevertheless refined aspects of Garrick's portrayal into his own.{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=124–125}} However it was the &quot;towering and majestic&quot; [[Sarah Siddons]] (Kemble's sister) who became a legend in the role of Lady Macbeth.{{sfn|Potter|2001|p=189}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=125–126}} In contrast to Hannah Pritchard's savage, demonic portrayal, Siddons' Lady Macbeth, while terrifying, was nevertheless – in the scenes in which she expresses her regret and remorse – tenderly human.{{sfn|Moody|2002|p=43}} And in portraying her actions as done out of love for her husband, Siddons deflected from him some of the moral responsibility for the play's carnage.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=125}} Audiences seem to have found the sleepwalking scene particularly mesmerising: [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]] said of it that &quot;all her gestures were involuntary and mechanical ... She glided on and off the stage almost like an apparition.&quot;{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=159}}

In 1794, Kemble dispensed with the ghost of Banquo altogether, allowing the audience to see Macbeth's reaction as his wife and guests see it, and relying upon the fact that the play was so well known that his audience would already be aware that a ghost enters at that point.{{sfn|McLuskie|2005|pp=256–257}}

[[Ferdinand Fleck]], notable as the first German actor to present Shakespeare's tragic roles in their fullness, played Macbeth at the Berlin National Theatre from 1787. Unlike his English counterparts, he portrayed the character as achieving his stature after the murder of Duncan, growing in presence and confidence: thereby enabling stark contrasts, such as in the banquet scene, which he ended babbling like a child.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=126}}

====Nineteenth century====

{{quote box|width=23em|&quot;Everyone seems to think Mrs McB is a ''Monstrousness'' &amp; ''I'' can only see she's a ''woman'' – a mistaken woman – &amp; ''weak'' – not a Dove – of course not – ''but first of all a wife.''&quot;|—[[Ellen Terry]]{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=167}}}}

Performances outside the patent theatres were instrumental in bringing the monopoly to an end. [[Robert William Elliston|Robert Elliston]], for example, produced a popular adaptation of ''Macbeth'' in 1809 at the [[Surrey Theatre|Royal Circus]] described in its publicity as &quot;this matchless piece of pantomimic and choral performance&quot;, which circumvented the illegality of speaking Shakespeare's words through mimed action, singing, and doggerel verse written by J. C. Cross.{{sfn|Holland|2007|pp=38–39}}{{sfn|Moody|2002|pp=38–39}}

[[File:Charles Kean as Macbeth 1858.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ellen Kean]] and [[Charles Kean]] as the Macbeths, in historically accurate costumes]]

In 1809, in an unsuccessful attempt to take [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] upmarket, [[John Philip Kemble|Kemble]] installed private boxes, increasing admission prices to pay for the improvements. The inaugural run at the newly renovated theatre was ''Macbeth'', which was disrupted for over two months with cries of &quot;Old prices!&quot; and &quot;No private boxes!&quot; until Kemble capitulated to the protestors' demands.{{sfn|Lanier|2002|p=37}}

[[Edmund Kean]] at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] gave a psychological portrayal of the central character, with a common touch, but was ultimately unsuccessful in the role. However he did pave the way for the most acclaimed performance of the nineteenth century, that of [[William Macready|William Charles Macready]]. Macready played the role over a 30-year period, firstly at Covent Garden in 1820 and finally in his retirement performance. Although his playing evolved over the years, it was noted throughout for the tension between the idealistic aspects and the weaker, venal aspects of Macbeth's character. His staging was full of spectacle, including several elaborate royal processions.{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=126–127}}

[[File:Charles Macready as Macbeth.jpg|thumb|A print of [[William Charles Macready]] playing Macbeth, from a mid-19th century performance]]
In 1843 the [[Theatres Act 1843|Theatres Regulation Act]] finally brought the patent companies' monopoly to an end.{{sfn|Moody|2002|p=38}} From that time until the end of the [[Victorian era]], London theatre was dominated by the [[actor-manager]]s, and the style of presentation was &quot;pictorial&quot; – [[proscenium]] stages filled with spectacular stage-pictures, often featuring complex scenery, large casts in elaborate costumes, and frequent use of [[Tableau vivant|tableaux vivant]].{{sfn|Schoch|2002|pp=58–59}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=128}} [[Charles Kean]] (son of Edmund), at London's [[Princess's Theatre, London|Princess's Theatre]] from 1850 to 1859, took an antiquarian view of Shakespeare performance, setting his ''Macbeth'' in a historically accurate eleventh-century Scotland.{{sfn|Schoch|2002|pp=61–62}} His leading lady, [[Ellen Kean|Ellen Tree]], created a sense of the character's inner life: ''[[The Times]]''{{'}} critic saying &quot;The countenance which she assumed ... when luring on Macbeth in his course of crime, was actually appalling in intensity, as if it denoted a hunger after guilt.&quot;{{sfn|Gay|2002|pp=163–164}} At the same time, special effects were becoming popular: for example in [[Samuel Phelps]]' ''Macbeth'' the witches performed behind green [[gauze]], enabling them to appear and disappear using stage lighting.{{sfn|Schoch|2002|p=64}}

In 1849, rival performances of the play sparked the [[Astor Place Riot]] in [[Manhattan]]. The popular American actor [[Edwin Forrest]], whose Macbeth was said to be like &quot;the ferocious chief of a barbarous tribe&quot;{{sfn|Morrison|2002|p=237}} played the central role at the Broadway Theatre to popular acclaim, while the &quot;cerebral and patrician&quot;{{sfn|Lanier|2002|p=37}} English actor [[William Macready|Macready]], playing the same role at the [[Astor Opera House|Astor Place Opera House]], suffered constant heckling. The existing enmity between the two men (Forrest had openly hissed Macready at a recent performance of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in Britain) was taken up by Forrest's supporters – formed from the working class and lower middle class and anti-British agitators, keen to attack the upper-class pro-British patrons of the Opera House and the colonially-minded Macready. Nevertheless, Macready performed the role again three days later to a packed house while an angry mob gathered outside. The militia tasked with controlling the situation fired into the mob. In total, 31 rioters were killed and over 100 injured.{{sfn|Lanier|2002|p=37}}{{sfn|Booth|2001|pp=311–312}}{{sfn|Holland|2002|p=202}}{{sfn|Morrison|2002|p=238}}&lt;!-- Note that these sources are in disagreement about the number of casualties: Lanier says 21. --&gt;&lt;!-- And, yes, you do need all four of these sources to get every point made in this paragraph! --&gt;

[[File:Ellen Terry plays Lady Macbeth.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of [[Ellen Terry]] as Lady Macbeth, an 1888 production]]
[[Charlotte Cushman]] is unique among nineteenth century interpreters of Shakespeare in achieving stardom in roles of both genders. Her New York debut was as Lady Macbeth in 1836, and she would later be admired in London in the same role in the mid-1840s.{{sfn|Morrison|2002|p=239}}{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=162}} [[Helena Faucit|Helen Faucit]] was considered the embodiment of early-Victorian notions of femininity. But for this reason she largely failed when she eventually played Lady Macbeth in 1864: her serious attempt to embody the coarser aspects of Lady Macbeth's character jarred harshly with her public image.{{sfn|Gay|2002|pp=161–162}} [[Adelaide Ristori]], the great Italian actress, brought her Lady Macbeth to London in 1863 in Italian, and again in 1873 in an English translation cut in such a way as to be, in effect, Lady Macbeth's tragedy.{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=164}}

[[Henry Irving]] was the most successful of the late-Victorian [[actor-manager]]s, but his ''Macbeth'' failed to curry favour with audiences. His desire for psychological credibility reduced certain aspects of the role: He described Macbeth as a brave soldier but a moral coward, and played him untroubled by conscience – clearly already contemplating the murder of Duncan before his encounter with the witches.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=129}}{{efn|Similar criticisms were made of [[Friedrich Mitterwurzer]] in Germany, whose performances of ''Macbeth'' had many unintentional parallels with Irving's.{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=129–130}}}} Irving's leading lady was [[Ellen Terry]], but her Lady Macbeth was unsuccessful with the public, for whom a century of performances influenced by Sarah Siddons had created expectations at odds with Terry's conception of the role.{{sfn|Gay|2002|pp=166–167}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=130}}

Late nineteenth-century European Macbeths aimed for heroic stature, but at the expense of subtlety: [[Tommaso Salvini]] in Italy and [[Adalbert Matkowsky]] in Germany were said to inspire awe, but elicited little pity.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=130}}

====20th century to present====
{{quote box|width=23em|&quot;And then Lady Macbeth says 'He that's coming / Must be provided for.' It's an amazing line. She's going to play hostess to Duncan at Dunsinane, and 'provide' is what gracious hostesses always do. It's a wonder of a line to play because the reverberations do the acting for you, make the audience go 'Aaaagh!'&quot;|—[[Sinéad Cusack]]{{sfn|McLuskie|2005|p=253}}}}

Two developments changed the nature of ''Macbeth'' performance in the 20th century: first, developments in the craft of acting itself, especially the ideas of [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] and [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]]; and second, the rise of the dictator as a political icon. The latter has not always assisted the performance: it is difficult to sympathise with a Macbeth based on Hitler, Stalin, or Idi Amin.{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=130–131}}

[[Barry Jackson (director)|Barry Jackson]], at the [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]] in 1923, was the first of the 20th-century directors to costume ''Macbeth'' in [[modern dress]].{{sfn|Smallwood|2002|p=102}}

[[File:Macbeth-26A-Carter-Thomas.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jack Carter (actor)|Jack Carter]] and Edna Thomas in the [[Federal Theatre Project]] production that came to be known as the ''[[Voodoo Macbeth]]'' (1936)]]

In 1936, a decade before his film adaptation of the play, [[Orson Welles]] directed ''Macbeth'' for the [[Federal Theatre Project#African-American theatre|Negro Theatre Unit]] of the [[Federal Theatre Project]] at the [[Lafayette Theatre (Harlem)|Lafayette Theatre]] in Harlem, using black actors and setting the action in Haiti: with drums and [[Haitian Vodou|Voodoo]] rituals to establish the Witches scenes. The production, dubbed ''The [[Voodoo Macbeth]]'', proved inflammatory in the aftermath of the [[Harlem Riot of 1935|Harlem riots]], accused of making fun of black culture and as &quot;a campaign to burlesque negroes&quot; until Welles persuaded crowds that his use of black actors and voodoo made important cultural statements.{{sfn|Forsyth|2007|p=284}}{{sfn|Hawkes|2003|p=577}}

[[File:Fort St. Catherine's, St. George's Island, Bermuda.jpg|thumb|Fort St. Catherine's, Bermuda, the site of a 1953 outdoor production]]
A performance which is frequently referenced as an example of the play's curse was the outdoor production directed by [[Burgess Meredith]] in 1953 in the [[British Overseas Territory|British colony]] of [[Bermuda]], starring [[Charlton Heston]]. Using the imposing spectacle of [[Fort St. Catherine]] as a key element of the set, the production was plagued by a host of mishaps, including Charlton Heston being burned when his tights caught fire.{{sfn|Hardy|2014}}{{sfn|Bernews|2013}}

The critical consensus is that there have been three great Macbeths on the English-speaking stage in the 20th century, all of them commencing at [[Stratford-upon-Avon]]: [[Laurence Olivier]] in 1955, [[Ian McKellen]] in 1976 and [[Antony Sher]] in 1999.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=131}} Olivier's portrayal (directed by [[Glen Byam Shaw]], with [[Vivien Leigh]] as Lady Macbeth) was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. [[Kenneth Tynan]] expressed the view that it succeeded because Olivier built the role to a climax at the end of the play, whereas most actors spend all they have in the first two acts.{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=130–131}}{{sfn|Brooke|2008|pp=47–48}}

The play caused grave difficulties for the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], especially at the (then) [[Royal Shakespeare Theatre|Shakespeare Memorial Theatre]]. [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]]'s 1967 production was (in Michael Billington's words) &quot;an acknowledged disaster&quot; with the use of real leaves from Birnham Wood getting unsolicited first-night laughs, and [[Trevor Nunn]]'s 1974 production was (Billington again) &quot;an over-elaborate religious spectacle&quot;.{{sfn|Billington|2003|p=599}} But Nunn achieved success for the RSC in his 1976 production at the intimate [[The Other Place (theatre)|Other Place]], with [[Ian McKellen]] and [[Judi Dench]] in the central roles.{{sfn|Billington|2003|pp=599–600}} A small cast worked within a simple circle, and McKellen's Macbeth had nothing noble or likeable about him, being a manipulator in a world of manipulative characters. They were a young couple, physically passionate, &quot;not monsters but recognisable human beings&quot;,{{efn|Michael Billington, cited by Gay.{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=169}}}} but their relationship atrophied as the action progressed.{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=132–134}}{{sfn|Gay|2002|p=169}}

In Soviet-controlled Prague in 1977, faced with the illegality of working in theatres, [[Pavel Kohout]] adapted ''Macbeth'' into a 75-minute abridgement for five actors, suitable for &quot;bringing a show in a suitcase to people's homes&quot;.{{sfn|Holland|2007|p=40}}{{efn|See also [[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[Dogg's Hamlet, Cahoot's Macbeth]]''.}}

Spectacle was unfashionable in Western theatre throughout the 20th century. In East Asia, however, spectacular productions have achieved great success, including [[Yukio Ninagawa]]'s 1980 production with [[Masane Tsukayama]] as Macbeth, set in the 16th century [[Sengoku period|Japanese Civil War]].{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=134–135}} The same director's tour of London in 1987 was widely praised by critics, even though (like most of their audience) they were unable to understand the significance of Macbeth's gestures, the huge Buddhist altar dominating the set, or the petals falling from the cherry trees.{{sfn|Holland|2002|p=207}} [[Xu Xiaozhong]]'s 1980 [[Central Academy of Drama]] production in Beijing made every effort to be unpolitical (necessary in the aftermath of the [[Cultural Revolution]]): yet audiences still perceived correspondences between the central character (whom the director had actually modelled on [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon]]) and [[Mao Zedong]].{{sfn|Gillies|Minami|Li|Trivedi|2002|p=268}} Shakespeare has often been adapted to indigenous theatre traditions, for example the ''[[Kunqu|Kunju]] Macbeth'' of [[Huang Zuolin]] performed at the inaugural Chinese Shakespeare Festival of 1986.{{sfn|Gillies|Minami|Li|Trivedi|2002|p=270}} Similarly, [[B. V. Karanth]]'s ''Barnam Vana'' of 1979 had adapted ''Macbeth'' to the [[Yakshagana]] tradition of [[Karnataka]], India.{{sfn|Gillies|Minami|Li|Trivedi|2002|pp=276–278}} In 1997, [[Lokendra Arambam]] created ''Stage of Blood'', merging a range of martial arts, dance and gymnastic styles from [[Manipur]], performed in [[Imphal]] and in England. The stage was literally a raft on a lake.{{sfn|Gillies|Minami|Li|Trivedi|2002|pp=278–279}}

The [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]] again achieved critical success in [[Gregory Doran]]'s 1999 production at [[Swan Theatre (Stratford)|The Swan]], with [[Antony Sher]] and [[Harriet Walter]] in the central roles, once again demonstrating the suitability of the play for smaller venues.{{sfn|Walter|2002|p=1}}{{sfn|Billington|2003|p=600}} Doran's witches spoke their lines to a theatre in absolute darkness, and the opening visual image was the entrance of Macbeth and Banquo in the berets and fatigues of modern warfare, carried on the shoulders of triumphant troops.{{sfn|Billington|2003|p=600}} In contrast to Nunn, Doran presented a world in which king Duncan and his soldiers were ultimately benign and honest, heightening the deviance of Macbeth (who seems genuinely surprised by the witches' prophesies) and Lady Macbeth in plotting to kill the king. The play said little about politics, instead powerfully presenting its central characters' psychological collapse.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=134}}

The play has been translated and performed in various languages in different parts of the world, and ''Media Artists'' was the first to stage its [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] adaptation in [[India]]. The adaptation by Balram and the play directed by [[Samuel John]] have been universally acknowledged as a milestone in Punjabi theatre.{{sfn|The Tribune|2006}} The unique attempt involved trained theatre experts and the actors taken from a rural background in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]. Punjabi folk music imbued the play with the native ethos as the Scottish setting of Shakespeare's play was transposed into a Punjabi milieu.{{sfn|Tandon|2004}}

'''''A Storm of Swords''''' is the third of seven planned novels in ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', a [[fantasy]] series by American author [[George R. R. Martin]]. It was first published on August 8, 2000, in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name=&quot;Locus 2000-11&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/2000/Reviews/BookReview11bMillerOnMartin.html|title=Locu  Online Reviews: ''A Storm of Swords'' (August 2000)|last=Miller|first=Faren|date=November 2000|work=[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]|publisher=LocusMag.com|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a United States edition following in November 2000. Its publication was preceded by a novella called ''Path of the Dragon'', which collects some of the Daenerys Targaryen chapters from the novel into a single book.

At the time of its publication, ''A Storm of Swords'' was the longest novel in the series. It was so long that in the UK, Australia and Israel its paperback edition was split in half, Part 1 being published as ''Steel and Snow'' in June 2001 (with the one-volume cover) and Part 2 as ''Blood and Gold'' in August 2001 (with a specially-commissioned new cover). The same division was used in the Polish and Greek editions. In France, the decision was made to cut the novel into four separate volumes.

''A Storm of Swords'' won the 2001 [[Locus Award]],&lt;ref name=&quot;WWE-2001&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[Meisha Merlin Publishing]], which had previously issued limited, illustrated editions of both ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'' and ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'', was planning to release a similar version for ''A Storm of Swords'' in two volumes; however, lengthy delays in the release of ''A Clash of Kings'' caused it to lose its publishing rights, which were picked up by [[Subterranean Press]]. This edition, illustrated by [[Charles Vess]], was released in the summer of 2006.

''A Storm of Swords'' is also the name of the second expansion to the [[board game]] ''[[A Game of Thrones (board game)|A Game of Thrones]]'', released in July 2006. Approximately the first half of the novel was adapted for television as the [[Game of Thrones (season 3)|third season]] of the [[HBO]] show ''[[Game of Thrones]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;GRRM 11 April 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=George R.

==Plot summary==
{{redirect|The Red Wedding|the television adaptation of the scene|The Rains of Castamere}}
''A Storm of Swords'' picks up the story slightly before the end of its predecessor, ''A Clash of Kings''. The Seven Kingdoms of [[Westeros]] are still in the grip of the War of the Five Kings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/War_of_the_Five_Kings War of the Five Kings] at ''A Wiki of Ice and Fire'' westeros.org, Retrieved 25 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; wherein [[Joffrey Baratheon]] and [[Stannis Baratheon]] compete for the [[Iron Throne (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Iron Throne]] while [[Robb Stark]] and [[Balon Greyjoy]] declare their independence. Meanwhile, a large host of [[wildlings]] approach [[the Wall (A Song of Ice and Fire)|the Wall]] under the leadership of [[Mance Rayder]], the self-proclaimed &quot;King Beyond the Wall&quot;, with only the undermanned [[Night's Watch]] in opposition. Finally, [[Daenerys Targaryen]] approaches [[Pentos (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Pentos]].

===In the Seven Kingdoms===

====The North / The Riverlands====
At [[Riverrun (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Riverrun]], [[Catelyn Stark]] offers the captive [[Jaime Lannister]] his freedom in exchange for Catelyn's daughters, [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Arya Stark|Arya]], who Catelyn believes are held by the Lannisters in [[King's Landing (A Song of Ice and Fire)|King's Landing]]. Jaime is sent south, escorted by [[Brienne of Tarth]]. Catelyn makes this deal without the approval of her son Robb, the King in the North, and is taken prisoner upon its discovery. Robb's army returns to Riverrun, having vanquished [[Tywin Lannister]]'s armies in the Westerlands, and Robb reveals that he has married [[Jeyne Westerling]], invalidating his promise to be wed to a daughter of [[House Frey]]. Jaime's release infuriates Lord Rickard Karstark, whose two sons Eddard and Torrhen had been killed by Jaime in battle; and in revenge, Karstark kills two young Lannister captives. To secure his authority and atone for these deaths (thus preventing the Lannisters from executing Stark prisoners), Robb executes Lord Rickard, losing the support of House Karstark as a result.

Jaime and Brienne are waylaid by the Brave Companions (now in the service of [[Roose Bolton]]) and taken to [[Harrenhal]]. Their captain Vargo Hoat orders Jaime's sword hand cut off, hoping the blame will be placed on Bolton, but Jaime is sent to King's Landing after he assures Lord Bolton he will absolve him to his father. Brienne is thrown into a [[bear]] pit by Hoat, and Jaime risks his own life to rescue her. He also tells her that he had killed the former King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] because he planned to burn the city and its inhabitants with wildfire to spite Robert Baratheon.

Robb's forces dwindle further at the Battle of Duskendale, wherein the eastern half of the Stark's armies, under the command of Roose Bolton, are ambushed by a joint army under [[Gregor Clegane]] and Lord Randyll Tarly. More losses are taken as the army retreats. Meanwhile, the [[House Greyjoy|Greyjoys]] now hold the Neck, having taken Moat Cailin, thus barring Robb from returning to his homeland. To recapture Moat Cailin from the Greyjoys, Robb relies on the support of the Freys. When Lord [[Hoster Tully]] dies, Catelyn's brother [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]] becomes Lord of Riverrun and Lord Paramount of the Trident. Robb gains renewed hope when he learns that Balon Greyjoy has died in a fall from a bridge, whereafter two of Balon's brothers, as well as his daughter [[Asha Greyjoy|Asha]], vie to succeed him. The Freys propose a wedding between Edmure and Roslin Frey, one of Lord Walder Frey's daughters, to compensate for the loss of Robb's marriage.

Arya Stark and her friends encounter the &quot;Brotherhood Without Banners&quot;, led by Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]] and the red priest [[Thoros of Myr]]: originally sent by Eddard Stark to put down the Lannister raids, the band now defends the [[peasant|smallfolk]] of the Riverlands. The group encounters [[Sandor Clegane]], known as the Hound, who abandoned Joffrey during the Battle of the Blackwater, and offers him [[trial by combat|trial by battle]], which he wins by killing Beric, but Thoros resurrects Beric thereafter. Arya is kidnapped by the Hound for ransom, and they proceed to Riverrun. On their journey, they discover that Robb and Catelyn will be at Edmure's wedding at the Frey bridge-stronghold [[The Twins (A Song of Ice and Fire)|The Twins]], and change their destination accordingly.

Robb Stark's army reaches the Twins, where Walder agrees to forgive Robb if the wedding between Edmure and Roslin takes place. At the wedding celebration, the Boltons and Freys turn on the Stark soldiers, massacring the Stark forces. Robb is murdered by Roose Bolton, while Catelyn has her throat cut by Raymund Frey and her body is thrown into the adjacent river. Many of the northern lords are killed, and the survivors captured. Edmure, after consummating his marriage, is kept as a hostage. These events become known as the Red Wedding.

It is thereafter revealed that Roose Bolton engineered the defeat at Duskendale by sending Robb's soldiers into a trap set by the Lannisters, while holding his own forces in reserve, and arranging that all but his own forces would be slaughtered in rearguard. The combined effect was to kill off the forces of other Northern houses loyal to Robb while leaving the Bolton army unscathed. Tywin Lannister (the King's Hand and grandfather) rewards Roose by naming House Bolton the Great House of the North, in place of [[House Stark]]. The crown also legitimizes Roose's bastard son [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]] as a Bolton and the new Lord of Winterfell.

Arya and the Hound arrive at the outskirts of the castle as the Red Wedding is taking place; to keep her from running inside to her death, the Hound knocks Arya unconscious and takes her downriver. As she sleeps, Arya sees through the eyes of her long-missing direwolf, Nymeria, that her mother Catelyn is dead, the direwolf pulling Catelyn's body from the river. Arya and the Hound encounter Gregor Clegane's men, by whom the Hound is wounded. His wound becomes infected, and Arya abandons him. She finds a ship from the Free City of [[Braavos]] and asks for passage to Eastwatch, but the captain refuses her passage until she offers him the coin and password &quot;Valar Morghulis&quot;, given to her by [[Jaqen H'ghar]]. The captain replies &quot;Valar Dohaeris&quot;, and they set sail.

In the [[epilogue]], a re-animated but decayed and mutilated Catelyn, now under the name Lady Stoneheart, is leading the Brotherhood Without Banners, Beric having given his life to resurrect her, and she oversees the lynching of two Freys present at the Red Wedding.

====The South / King's Landing====
After the Battle of the Blackwater, [[Davos Seaworth]] is taken to Dragonstone by men loyal to King Stannis. Stannis survived the Blackwater due to Rolland Storm commanding his rearguard and enabling him to escape to the fleet. Davos blames the red priestess [[Melisandre]] for Stannis's defeat and the deaths of his four eldest sons, and is imprisoned for treason (Melisandre having foreseen his intention to assassinate her). At Melisandre's behest, Stannis releases Davos and asks him to serve as his Hand. Stannis' previous Hand, his wife's uncle Lord Alester Florent, tried to make terms with the Lannisters behind Stannis' back, and has thus been arrested. With Stannis' cooperation, Melisandre has performed rituals to awaken &quot;stone dragons&quot;, which she identifies as the great statues adjacent to the castle.

King's Landing welcomes the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]] as liberators, and King Joffrey sets aside his betrothal to Sansa Stark in favor of [[Margaery Tyrell]]. Sansa is soon compelled to marry [[Tyrion Lannister]] to enable Lannister control of the North and to foil a Tyrell plot to marry her to Willas Tyrell and claim the North themselves. However Tyrion refuses to consummate the marriage against her will.

Word reaches King's Landing of the sudden death of Balon Greyjoy, followed by news of the Red Wedding. Joffrey gloats that he has &quot;won&quot; the war; whereas the governing Small Council is shocked to learn that Tywin secretly masterminded the Red Wedding. Tyrion warns his father that the defeated Northerners will not quietly submit to Bolton rule, but Tywin dismisses his warning. Later, Tyrion realizes that Joffrey sent the assassin who attempted to kill [[Bran Stark]] at Winterfell, and thus [[A Game of Thrones|set the war in motion]].

Margaery and Joffrey's wedding is held as planned, but during the ensuing festivities, King Joffrey is poisoned and dies. Tyrion is accused of the murder by his sister [[Cersei Lannister]] and placed on trial. Sansa is smuggled out of the castle by the jester Dontos Hollard, and taken to Lord [[Petyr Baelish|Petyr &quot;Littlefinger&quot; Baelish]], who has Dontos killed and admits culpability in Joffrey's death and Tyrion's framing, incriminating Margaery's grandmother Olenna Tyrell as well. Littlefinger and Sansa depart King's Landing for [[the Eyrie]], Littlefinger scheming to marry Catelyn's sister [[Lysa Arryn]] with the blessing of the Small Council to gain the support of House Arryn.

Davos discovers a request by the Night's Watch for aid against [[Mance Rayder]] and the [[Others (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Others]]. Melisandre tries to persuade Stannis to sacrifice [[Edric Storm]], a bastard son of Stannis' late brother King [[Robert Baratheon]], to wake the dragons. Stannis is reluctant, though he uses Edric's blood in leeches to curse the three rival Kings. After Balon, Robb and Joffrey die, apparently proving the power of King's blood, Davos has Edric smuggled to safety. Stannis prepares to execute Davos for treason but is prevented when Davos shows Stannis the Night's Watch's plea.

Jaime and Brienne reach King's Landing to find that Joffrey's younger brother [[Tommen Baratheon]] will inherit the throne; Tyrion is on trial; and the Tyrell bannermen blame Brienne for [[Renly Baratheon]]'s death. Jaime's severed right hand becomes infected, but he is healed by former maester Qyburn, who was thrown out of the Citadel for forbidden experiments, earning Qyburn the admiration of Cersei. Jaime refuses to believe that Tyrion killed Joffrey, rejects Cersei's advances, and becomes Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, but refuses his father's offer of [[Casterly Rock]], whereupon Tywin disinherits him. Jaime frees Brienne and gives her a sword reforged from Ice, Ned Stark's sword. He tells her to keep her oath to Catelyn, to find Arya and Sansa and return them home. Against Tyrion, Cersei recruits the spymaster [[Varys]] and Tyrion's lover, [[Shae (character)|Shae]]. Tyrion is approached by Prince [[Oberyn Martell]] of [[Dorne]], who offers a trial by combat against Cersei's champion, Gregor Clegane, who he knows was responsible for the death of his sister Elia. Oberyn nearly emerges victorious, but is ultimately killed by Gregor, although the poison on Oberyn's spear leaves Gregor dying in agony. Tyrion is again condemned to death but is freed by Jaime and Varys. Jaime reveals that Tyrion's first wife Tysha, who Tywin had gang-raped by his garrison and forced Tyrion to participate, was not a prostitute as Tywin told him, and genuinely loved Tyrion. Outraged, Tyrion swears revenge on Jaime, Cersei, and Tywin, and tells Jaime he murdered Joffrey and that Cersei took other lovers while he was Robb Stark's captive. During Tyrion's escape, he strangles Shae and kills Tywin in his privy before fleeing Westeros.

At the Eyrie, Littlefinger and Lysa are married, and Sansa remains hidden by pretending to be an illegitimate daughter of Littlefinger's, named Alayne Stone. Lysa reveals that Littlefinger had convinced her to poison [[Jon Arryn]], her late husband, to prevent her son from being fostered to Stannis Baratheon, and to write to Catelyn that Arryn had been poisoned by the Lannisters, which was the catalyst for the events of ''A Game of Thrones''. Lysa threatens to kill Sansa, thinking she is trying to seduce Littlefinger, but Littlefinger intervenes and, after revealing that he had only ever loved Catelyn, pushes Lysa to her death.

===On the Wall===
The detachment of the Night's Watch under Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] awaits word from [[Qhorin Halfhand]] and [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]] at their forward base. The Watch are attacked by [[undead]] [[wights]] and the Others, suffering heavy casualties; but [[Samwell Tarly]] kills one of the Others with a blade of [[obsidian|dragonglass]]. Some of the Watch [[mutiny]] and kill Mormont, but Sam escapes with the help of one of Craster's daughter-wives, Gilly, and they and the girl's newborn child approach the Wall, assisted by a strange figure riding an [[elk]], whom Sam calls Coldhands. Among the dead are most of the Watch's senior leadership.

Bran Stark, his servant [[Hodor (character)|Hodor]], [[Jojen Reed|Jojen]] and [[Meera Reed]] are guided north by Bran's dreams of a three-eyed crow. At the Wall, Sam guides them to Coldhands and returns to Castle Black, having sworn to keep Bran's survival secret even from Jon.

Jon convinces Mance that he is a deserter from the Night's Watch and learns that the Others are driving the wildlings south towards the Wall. Jon and his captor [[Ygritte]] also begin a sexual relationship. Mance seeks the legendary Horn of Winter to shatter the Wall. After climbing the Wall, the wildlings press Jon to murder a homeless man. When Jon refuses, the wildlings turn on him but Jon, with the assistance of Bran's direwolf Summer (Bran and company are hiding in a nearby abandoned tower), kills many of the wildlings and escapes to Castle Black. The approaching wildling army reaches Castle Black and assaults the Wall; but Jon takes command of the defenses and repels several assaults, during which Ygritte is slain. After that, [[Janos Slynt]] and [[Alliser Thorne]] imprison Jon for treachery and subsequently send him north of the Wall to kill Mance under a pretense of parley. As Jon is talking with Mance in the wildling camp, the army of King Stannis arrives, routing the Wildlings, and Mance is imprisoned. Melisandre believes the wildling invasion to portend the return of the Great Other, the sworn foe of her god [[R'hllor]]. Stannis offers to legitimize Jon and make him Lord of Winterfell in exchange for his support, but when his direwolf Ghost unexpectedly returns, Jon decides to decline Stannis' offer. Before he can inform Stannis, Jon is chosen by the Night's Watch as its new Lord Commander.

===Across the Narrow Sea===
Heading for [[Pentos (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Pentos]] by sea, [[Daenerys Targaryen]] learns that large slave armies can be bought in the cities of [[Slaver's Bay]], and exchanges one of her infant dragons for the entire host of the warrior-eunuch [[The Unsullied|Unsullied]]. Upon payment, which includes Drogon (the largest and strongest of her dragons), Daenerys orders the Unsullied to turn on their former masters and sack the city. With the help of her maturing dragons, she frees all the slaves of [[Astapor]]. Daenerys' [[Army|horde]] then conquers the slaver city of [[Yunkai]]; but the lords of neighbouring [[Meereen]] antagonize Daenerys by killing child slaves and burning the land to deny her resources. Consequently, Daenerys besieges the city to no avail.

Daenerys discovers two traitors in her camp: Ser [[Jorah Mormont]], who had spied on her for Varys, informant to the late King Robert Baratheon, in exchange for a royal pardon; and Arstan Whitebeard, an alias of Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], the humiliated former Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard. Daenerys offers both men the chance to make amends by sneaking into Meereen to free the slaves and start an uprising. Meereen soon falls and, in retaliation for the murdered child slaves, Daenerys has the city's rulers put to death. Selmy asks for Daenerys' forgiveness and becomes Lord Commander of her Queensguard while Jorah, who refuses to admit any wrong, is banished. When Daenerys learns that the council she left in Astapor has been overthrown, she decides to rule Meereen to practice for the rule of Westeros.

==Reception==

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said the third volume was &quot;one of the more rewarding examples of gigantism in contemporary fantasy. [...] The complexity of characters such as Daenerys, Arya and the Kingslayer will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like Tolkien or Jordan, makes us care about their fates. Those two fantasy greats are also evoked by Martin's ability to convey such sensual experiences as the heat of wildfire, the chill of ice, the smell of the sea and the sheer gargantuan indigestibility of the medieval banquet at its most excessive. Perhaps this saga doesn't go as far beyond the previous bounds of high fantasy as some claim, but for most readers it certainly goes far enough to command their attention.&quot;&lt;ref name=pw_review_asos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-553-10663-3 |title=Fiction review: ''A Storm of Swords'' |publisher=publishersweekly.com |date=October 30, 2000 |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was nominated for the 2001 [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]], but lost to [[J. K. Rowling]] for ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWE-2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugo 2001&quot; /&gt; Afterwards he made this comment about his fans: &quot;Eat your heart out, Rowling.
